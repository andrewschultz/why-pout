The grin churls remark that you seemed so nice, really, and they're all for a bit of banter, but they know when to fully move on from people like you who just don't shut up.

>tree small
Amidst all the fake trees, an actual organic small tree grows. You're a bit disappointed, but you realize you maybe shouldn't have expected much with so little letter-shuffling. Maybe if you want a bigger tree, you'll need to do something else.
But wait! You can use the grow vial! It makes the tree (small) into a tree (tall)! Then it dissolves once empty.
