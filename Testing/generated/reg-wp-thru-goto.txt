"Grey trek? Great wreck!" you moon. You can't see anywhere. You know almost nothing. You don't even have a name.
What would you do even if there was a passage?

#testcase-goto-table-of-noways-wolf-rock

Wolf Rock blocks every planar passage except back SOUTH. Maybe something's under the lode ore as well--it's dense.

#testcase-goto-table-of-noways-hideout

You can only go back UP. You're sort of glad it's not a deluxe or exciting hideout, really, since that'd just mean more to map out.

Apart from finding a way beyond the seedy sign, the keep doesn't have many twisty passages. Well, any.

#testcase-goto-table-of-noways-nigh-fright

You could leave, but then you'd have to come back. Just figure what to do here.

Apart from finding a way beyond the seedy sign, which you don't need to again, the keep doesn't have many twisty passages. Well, any.

You can go down or in the cardinal directions, but not up.

#testcase-goto-table-of-noways-wand-wharf

You're not in the mood for exploring the wharf randomly. It seems like a good way to get lost. Perhaps if you focus on a specific sort of companion you need nearby, that would be better. Then you could find them and leave.
