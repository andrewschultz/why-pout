>about
Like most of my games, Why Pout rates merciful on the Zarfian cruelty scale. However, in this case, I want the puzzles to be more merciful in terms of general difficulty on the player's psyche than usual.
Note that an optional room will appear about midway through the game. It may contain profanity, which I hope is amusing, but I don't blame you if you wish to skip it.
blurglecruncheon@gmail.com is my email, and http://github.com/andrewschultz/why-pout is the github site, where you can report issues. I'm open to transcripts.
CREDITS lists people who helped make Why Pout a reality, or a better version than it would've been without them.  EXT shows the extensions listed, and VERSION or VERSIONS shows version info.

>hint
Why Pout has no direct in-game hints. However, a walkthrough should be provided on itch.io or in the archive.org zip file bundle.
After two puzzles in this first room, there will be a hint item that gives clues what to do or think next. You will get a clue if you HINT again.

No, I don't know whether size Z is super-big or super-small.

>t
NOTE: without an argument for T, Why Pout will try to guess whom you talk to. It prioritizes friendly NPCs, especially ones you haven't talked to before, but if there is more than one, it will ask you to be more specific.
Self-talk is the way, but you need something positive and specific. All you can muster is "I molder. I'm older." You sort of wish for purpose, or something like it.

Hard not to hear the cell phones, though.
Whether or not the cell phones are the latest models, you don't want to pay attention to them too much. Just figure out a way for a harmless calamity that may make their users quiet down a bit.

>hint

You can EYE things with the sly size-slice eyes, or just EYE the whole room.

You chat with the new troll a bit, learning more about the history of the area you're exploring and why you're here.
The new troll relates ways to shake oneself free from despair (no! Really! It managed to for a while!) before relating more ways to avoid it in the first place, or help others you care about do the same.
It makes sense out of something odd you saw. Perhaps other friends will be able to help similarly.

[NOTE: if you want to see whom you haven't talked to yet, T by itself will do the trick. If there's only one companion you haven't talked to, you will talk to them]

>t
That's ambiguous--more than one friend you can chat with.
However, you still haven't talked with the rogue (old) and the gnome (old).

>t rogue old
You chat with the rogue (old) a bit, learning more about the history of the area you're exploring and why you're here.
The rogue (old) discusses ways to sneak around so vastly overpowered opponents can't blow you away, and you also learn not to feel guilty or shifty about being good at sneaking around, around much more unsavory entities than yourself.
The chat helps reassure you that you've missed nothing big, but you still have more to learn.

>t
You realize you've talked with everyone but the gnome (old), who may feel a bit left out. So...
You chat with the gnome (old) a bit, learning more about the history of the area you're exploring and why you're here.
The gnome (old) discusses ways of finding hidden psychic weaknesses in a very tough opponent. You also hear how whatever force there is, it only cares about things looking good on the outside. The gnome had so much mold to protect against and continually scrape away, even outside of the keep.
You throw around some other observations: a few, you should've realized, but no worries. You got it now.

That's ambiguous--more than one friend you can chat with.
However, you still haven't talked with the gaunt raider, the new troll, the rogue (old) and the gnome (old).

>t raider
You chat with the gaunt raider a bit, learning more about the history of the area you're exploring and why you're here.
The gaunt raider discusses regret for their past actions, as well as some possibilities for how to use it to boost yourself to do the right thing, or when to just drop it without being drowned by guilt.
It makes sense out of something odd you saw. Perhaps other friends will be able to help similarly.

It's been vandalized a bit, though, and maybe if you X again, you might find a fourth-wall way to warp around and, well, see the bare minimum of extra adventures it holds, without the, well, language.

>x wares
Oh, hey! You notice something scrawled on BRUISE-WARES. It says NAH, BYE. It seems negative on the surface but makes you believe if you can do the minimum you need to get in and out of that place and bypass the spicier stuff.

You'll have to win the argument with the grinch earls before any meaningful conversations.

You can't imagine any chat with them would be pleasant. "Help our hell-power?!"
Staunch, specific verbal defense is the way to get rid of them, here.

>t dwarf

You chat with the wan dwarf a bit, learning more about the history of the area you're exploring and why you're here.
The dwarf provides an impressively nuanced view on how to balance magic skill with physical skill and fighting savvy. But the dwarf also notes how to be a good expert in specific areas if need be, as well as how to get experts and generalists to work together. However, the dwarf also expresses worry that this talk is all great in theory but hard in practice.
It makes sense out of something odd you saw. Perhaps other friends will be able to help similarly.

>t elf

You chat with the mensch elf a bit, learning more about the history of the area you're exploring and why you're here.
The mensch elf discusses ways to identify people or situations that just need a bit of help, and how to do so without making them feel hopeless or in need of help, or that they got themselves in this position in the first place.
The chat helps reassure you that you've missed nothing big, but you still have more to learn.

>t gnome

You chat with the gnome (old) a bit, learning more about the history of the area you're exploring and why you're here.
The gnome (old) discusses ways of finding hidden psychic weaknesses in a very tough opponent. You also hear how whatever force there is, it only cares about things looking good on the outside. The gnome had so much mold to protect against and continually scrape away, even outside of the keep.
You throw around some other observations: a few, you should've realized, but no worries. You got it now.

>t rogue

You chat with the rogue (old) a bit, learning more about the history of the area you're exploring and why you're here.
The rogue (old) discusses ways to sneak around so vastly overpowered opponents can't blow you away, and you also learn not to feel guilty or shifty about being good at sneaking around, around much more unsavory entities than yourself.
Your chat nicely pieces together information from your other companions you talked to.

>t raider

You chat with the gaunt raider a bit, learning more about the history of the area you're exploring and why you're here.
The gaunt raider discusses regret for their past actions, as well as some possibilities for how to use it to boost yourself to do the right thing, or when to just drop it without being drowned by guilt.
You have a new perspective on something you, with your experience so far, were pretty sure was true. As well as something that would've blown your mind beforehand.

>t mice

You chat with the mice (tall) a bit, learning more about the history of the area you're exploring and why you're here.
You're surprised how easy it is to understand them and how easily they understand you. They discuss how much bigger opponents can be brought down by, not just arrogance facing many small opponents, but by dexterity and quick maneuvers. Oh, also a lot about the evil in the land killing or corrupting or mutating animals. So presumably finding or destroying it will put a stop to the very worst bits.
You realize the chat has filled in some holes you were curious about but felt sheepish asking.

>t troll

You chat with the new troll a bit, learning more about the history of the area you're exploring and why you're here.
The new troll relates ways to shake oneself free from despair (no! Really! It managed to for a while!) before relating more ways to avoid it in the first place, or help others you care about do the same.
Piecing together your chats with all your companions, you have a cohesive what/why/how. It's a bit confusing to spell out, but you've internalized how things fit together, how your friends will cooperate, and so forth.
That was a lot of talking. After all that time alone in the Tomb Apse, you feel a bit of social burnout. You develop a talk-ache.

>t troll
That talk-ache is a bit of a nuisance. You've probably got the information you need from your friends.
