#testcase-run-post-an-aim-rule-default
Yes. Now that you realize you want more than just to know your name, that you have bigger goals, you push a bit harder when you initially forget it. You remember patches of the past. You remember people harshly calling you by your last name, then your first.
Your name is Mike Orr. You even remember it's -- well, one of these two things: short for Michal, which everyone pronounced Michael until you just gave up, or ... well, Michael.
You look around a bit. You can see more, now. You're in some sort of tomb apse. You could exit--there are exits each way--but you suspect there's some horrible maze you could easily get lost in.

`Tomb Apse

>two maps
by a point

#testcase-run-post-two-maps-rule-default
You look around for secrets. You find one line that is a hash of horizontal lines and another that is a hash of vertical lines. You put them together ... and you see a maze. You hope you can trace a passage out. And, with some effort, you do! Then you follow it. You hope it's right, and it leads somewhere better, or at least not as awful...

`Hype Lane

>self owns
by a point

#testcase-run-post-self-owns-rule-default
You take a step back from all the confident, constant chatter in the cell phones. You hear that, indeed, people are just repeating mantras, and they are not as smart as they think they are. You wonder if you should say something to the most egregious offenders ... and you eventually do! And they appear flustered. They attack you back for being too quiet. You mention that if they annoyed someone as too-quiet as you, they must have gone over the line.
Your confrontation did not go unnoticed by other cell phoners. They take the hint and moderate their voices.
However, now, a prize talk blasts through hidden loudspeakers. It exhorts you to find your dream, to find something that will help you move above and beyond everyone else. It's probably talking about money or power, but you're looking for something different.

>pry stalk
by a point

#testcase-run-post-pry-stalk-rule-default
Among all the chatter, you discover a disused booth. Someone is preaching on about environmental stuff, and it's so much less painful than cell phone chat. You worry they're just going to blab on forever, but they're so grateful you listened as long as you did. They hand you a stalk they think can grow quickly. Their own special formula. It looks weird and glittery, and if anything can reach up out of here, this can. But the question is, where can it grow to?

>high plain
by a point

#testcase-run-post-high-plain-rule-default
You plant the stalk, which -- well, it's already a bit of a stalk, but it grows quickly and sturdily. It's not hard at all to climb. You are pretty sure you're aboveground, but it's hard to see for sure.

>nah phase
by a point

#testcase-run-post-nah-phase-rule-default
The haze seemed too thick at first. But you recognize it doesn't have to be there. As you sift through it, you notice things that weren't there before. It lifts.

>pole east
by a point

#testcase-run-post-pole-east-rule-default
Ah, yes. It makes sense. You find the pole. Strangely, there's just a single switch to flip. And even more strangely, the switch you flip causes the pole to revert into the ground. Yay!
But there's more! A war pawn, like a chess piece, rolls into view. It looks pretty powerful. As you take it, you reflect that you may wish to save it for down the road when you're really stuck somewhere. You have a good idea HOW to use it, at any rate.

>shore trail
by a point

#testcase-run-post-shore-trail-rule-default
There must be more to the short rail than you see. And you start tracing where it is, where it can be, where it should go. You find something to dig up. It's ... surprisingly malleable. You have nothing else to do, anyway. Soon it feels like pulling cable from a ground. It's tough, since you can't see around, but indeed, the short rail does lead to a shore trail that leads south.

>grow star
by a point

#testcase-run-post-grow-star-rule-default
You look at the gross tar, and you hope for a star in the sky to become brighter. It does, and clearly some of the tar is goopier than some of the other tar. You see a way to the north, and after you do, the tar isn't as relevant any more.

>key pillar
by a point

#testcase-run-post-key-pillar-rule-default
You look around the pillars for a key, since there's no flowerpot to hide it under. You find one, and once it unlocks the way west, you hide it, again.
You've changed the landscape a lot, north, south, east and west. But there's more! You hear a rumbling beneath you, opening a passage DOWN!

#testcase-run-post-known-ocean-rule-default
Ah, yes. Things clear up a bit now. There we go ... you see where an ocean should be, and ... yes, you dip your toe in some wetness. Things clear up. You even see a sick squid! Maybe you can help it.

#+testcase-room-names-no-notion
`Known Ocean

>six quid
by a point

#testcase-run-post-six-quid-rule-default
You have an idea what is bothering the squid. Yes, a few coins stuck. Surprisingly, it lets you help out. "Current, sea, currency," you mutter as you poke around. Ah, there you go.
You offer to give it some of the coins it almost choked on, but it does not need them. It seems to wait around, as if to help you with travel to places you may get to go. It's willing to wait.

#testcase-run-post-wool-frock-rule-default
You rummage about and find a wool frock.

>hide out
by a point

#testcase-run-post-hide-out-rule-default
It's easy enough to say you should doubt yourself less. I mean, you'd feel stupid doubting it. But there's always a reason not to. Still, you involuntarily start a mantra: "Fine, doubt? Find out!"
And what do you know? You find a hideout below!

`Hideout

>boost role
by a point

#testcase-run-post-boost-role-rule-default
You talk with the booze troll for a bit. They seem not to know who they are, and that gives you something in common with them. They don't want to be a lousy boozer all their life. They are sick of drinking Base Ale.
You decide to trust them. They don't seem armed. You mention you've been having an adventure, and they'd sort of like one, too. They hand you a bottle of Base Ale as thanks. Not that they want you to go down their road. But it might be useful in bartering.
It looks like the new troll will be following you around. All that silence might get awkward, so you may wish to T or TALK (TO) them.

#testcase-room-names-keep-iller
`Keep (Iller)
This keep has seen better days, but there seems to be a lot in its ruins. You can go back EAST. You also sense something fearsome from a passage south.
You are really impressed by how no mold grows here. Someone must be keeping it up well. Who?
A row (gold) shines in this otherwise forbidding keep.
There's a bunch of manic herb here. You don't know a lot about it, other than that some is really poisonous and some is okay. There's so much, perhaps it's hiding something.
A plant racker lies here, pretty much useless.
A seedy sign stands here, advertising somewhere very risky indeed.

>gnome old
by a point

#testcase-run-post-gnome-old-rule-default
A gnome, old, arrives from a room above in the keep. They offer to adventure with you, if you have suitable enough adventuring gear. As a matter of fact, you do. The wool frock works well.
"Less gnome attic, more nomadic," they muse.
Funnily, you stop specifically noticing the lack of mold now your new companion's joined you. But you still appreciate their efforts deep down!

>rogue old
by a point

#testcase-run-post-rogue-old-rule-default
A rogue, old, arrives. They mention they'd like to help you but, you know, the row (gold) needs maintenance. You offer to pay them three quid.
This transaction reduces your wealth from six quid to three quid.

NOTE: in order to simplify things now you've grown your party, you can type UH PARTY or A PARTY so everyone is not listed individually. APART EEE will list them individually again. This is all in VERBS.

>see design

#testcase-run-post-see-design-rule-default
You see the design in the seedy sign. It leads somewhere scary. Somewhere you don't want your friends to visit. Though you appreciate their support. You'll be right back. You think. You hope.
Whatever you need to do or find here, you only want to do it once. You don't want to have to come back. You're glad your friends supported you enough to get here, but you don't want to have to rely on them like that again.
So, what do you need to find, before getting out?

#testcase-run-post-gaunt-raider-rule-default
After some discussion, you work out a plan to make the gone trader reframe what they did. Whoever they were, the evil powers, they rejected them instead of doubling down. Perhaps there is a way to get back at them. They know things you never could hope to.
Hmm. You have a lot of friends following you around, but you haven't talked to them much. Perhaps you could learn something from them.

#testcase-run-post-weak-us-rule-default
#testcase-run-post-weak-us-rule-follow-the-cycle-swears-rule
You're surprised how just making a little shift can make the grinch earls seem much weaker. Their strength is the sort of brute force that doesn't lift other people up.
They throw down the gauntlet at this point. Don't you know cussing shows higher intelligence? Some study or other showed that!
The crude orc looks back and forth between you and the grinch earls, glaring at them a bit, but not yet ready to break free. Just a bit more, and you may gain a friend.
Your observation has caused something to "righteously" snap in the grinch earls. And boy, are they going to firehose you with their "best!"
The grinch earls shake their heads at you: "Bah! Sturdy?!"

>crew dork
by a bonus point

#testcase-run-post-crew-dork-rule-default
You break the truth gently to the crude orc that, well, they're at the bottom of the totem pole for this crew. They'll use the crude orc, maybe even not let them into the clique, and then find the next sucker. The grinch earls surprisingly have little response to this besides, well, profanity.
The crude orc sees it now. The grinch earls weren't as friendly as they seemed. They wanted to use some trusting kid and corrupt them. The crude orc shakes their head. They ask if they can be seen as an orc and not, well, a dork. You say sure.
You've gained a friend! You can stick around to torment the grinch earls further, or you can go on your way.
Hmm. You have a lot of friends following you around, but you haven't talked to them much. Perhaps you could learn something from them.

>bastard eee
by a bonus point

#testcase-run-post-bastard-eee-rule-default
You show you're sturdy and then some, with just the right tone of exasperation. They pretend not to be impressed, but they don't have a comeback.
The grinch earls mock you, or maybe boost themselves, with "Heh, class!"

>heckle ass
by a bonus point

#testcase-run-post-heckle-ass-rule-default
You give back at least as good as you got, showing you don't need to use the big cuss words to get a point in as well.
The grinch earls laugh and say "Hush it."

>huh shit
by a bonus point

#testcase-run-post-huh-shit-rule-default
You reject the grinch earls' "urbane" attempts at shutting you up. They're a bit surprised at you.
The grinch earls take cheap shots and say "Life occurs."

>lie fuckers
by a bonus point

#testcase-run-post-lie-fuckers-rule-default
You cut down the grinch earls for making things more bleak than they are. Sure, life can be cruel, but that's no excuse to make it even more cruel. They give a "whatever," but you see the point touched home.
The grinch earls launch "Weird! Ick!"
s at enemies real and imagined.

>were dicks
by a bonus point

#testcase-run-post-were-dicks-rule-default
You mock the grinch earls back, giving at least as good as you get, noting there's always a hole in these sorts of attacks.
The grinch earls, out of insults, give up on you, claiming you got boring. But you know better.

>grin churls
by a bonus point

#testcase-run-post-grin-churls-rule-default
You slip in a few sly digs and say "grin, churls." They shake their heads, annoyed.
The grin churls remark that you seemed so open-minded, really, and they're all for a bit of banter, but they know when to fully move on from people like you who just don't shut up. So they do.

#testcase-run-post-low-bend-rule-default
You almost despair for a minute that you reached a dead end so soon. You page through all the possible ways out, proving to yourself you're right, hoping against hope you're wrong.
And looking around, you see you are! There is a bit more to all this. A very thin and reasonably sloped path north leads down to some water. Which you can't cross at the moment, but maybe you'll figure a way.

>bay sale

#testcase-run-post-bay-sale-rule-default
You have money, and you are ready for a sale, and you get it. Unfortunately, though you were expecting a nice big ship, you get something a little humbler, namely a We-Craft Weak Raft. It seems sturdy enough, though, and it does have a sail.
You christen it with the base ale, and the bottle fragments shatter and float away in the water.
This transaction reduces your wealth from three quid to one quid.

>mensch elf

#testcase-run-post-mensch-elf-rule-default
You knock about the MEN shelf a bit, unable to find anything. It's really a collection of shelves that you disassemble and reassemble. Eventually, you're about to give up, and it all collapses, taking a chunk of wall with it. Our pops a mensch elf, quite grateful you helped them escape.
Hmm. You have a lot of friends following you around, but you haven't talked to them much. Perhaps you could learn something from them.

>mice tall

#testcase-run-post-mice-tall-rule-default
You look into the stall and shrug your shoulders. Then the gnome (old) steps in and notes they hear something. Chittering noises! The gnome chitters back.
It takes a lot of negotiating, but you find where the mice are stuck. You and the gnome thud through and out come some mice, tall. They're tall for mice, though they really only come up above your knee.

>summer chant

#testcase-run-post-summer-chant-rule-default
You think up a summer chant you mumble under your breath. The merchant finds it a bit weird you like THAT as a way to keep positive. It doesn't seem like that sort of thing helps the economy. Their cheeriness slips slightly, with impressively-balanced potshots at people more and less successful than they are.

>bile oh
by a point

#testcase-run-post-bile-oh-rule-default
The mere suggestion that the merchant's aggression may be annoying seems to set them off. No, no, it's people like YOU who are the problem. Without dynamic positivity like theirs, you're totally screwed! You're just jealous you don't have it!
You freeze up, confused by all this, and the merchant takes this as a sign of arrogant disrespect. You are not the first person to reject their positivity! They run into clueless crumb-bums all day!
They storm off, presumably to find another crumb-bum to abuse for not having their brand of positivity.
Oh, hey, you can maybe enjoy some solitude now!

You act distracted just right. The oaf liar tries to get your attention. Just ignoring them wouldn't work, but paying attention to a flier ... well, they take the hint that you aren't a high-rolling customer. They try to wheedle more money out of you, but of course, that's all you have. So you trade your final quid for the flier. The oaf liar thanks you for not totally wasting their time. They seem to snicker as they depart.
This transaction reduces your wealth from one quid to zero quid.

The squid gives you and your companions a ride a few miles across the ocean. You realize you could reach the wharf isle for a war file.
When you get there, you're a bit disappointed by what you see. There's a bit too much emphasis on magic and the implements thereof, all of which are at a much too hefty price for you. So buying equipment is out.
Still, there are many ideas worth tracking. Your companions help with the process, offering ideas you're pleasantly surprised to hear.
You write the main stuff into your plan tracker, and as you do, you realize part of the plan points to having another party member not in your entourage. Well, yet. Perhaps someone else here has read the war file and maybe found less splashy ways to fight. You stay to look around...

The wan dwarf thinks for a minute, then starts filling in some blanks in your plan. Not to criticize, just ... you thought of some things they didn't, and they thought of some you didn't.

The gaunt raider, in particular, has a lot to say, of past things they did that were horrible, that they think they're sorry for, but maybe not enough.
Everyone assures the raider that they're the good guys now.
You offer the gaunt raider the knife (right) as a present. They seem scared to take it, but it doesn't burst into flames when they take it, so ... it must be right for them.

The gaunt raider raises a hand. They have an idea! The abandoned mall must have all sorts of stuff that can be fashioned into weapons. Not top-of-the-line, but enough to get by. Heartened by your recent meal, your party takes the time to find weapons. You all keep them hidden until needed.

It begins pouring out rivers of blood at you and your companions. But fortunately, you have so many, that by the time it gets to you, it is not so bad. Yet it's still depressing. You think back to advice you got at the beginning ... how it seemed slightly off. What to do?

Easier said than done, but since you all studied the plan tracker so well, it isn't impossible!
Your makeshift weapons are just enough to distract the sea skull. It starts to focus on one party member, then the others taunt it, and it turns away. It's exhausting for you but even more exhausting for the skull, which eventually collapses and incinerates.
But after all the fireworks, there's a letdown. You feel something odd come between you and your companions now you're done. They wonder why they need to do any more. You could call the whole zeitgeist a why-division.
