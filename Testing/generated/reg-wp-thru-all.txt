Yes. Now that you realize you want more than just to know your name, that you have bigger goals, you push a bit harder when you initially forget it. You remember patches of the past. You remember people harshly calling you by your last name, then your first.
Your name is Mike Orr. You even remember it's -- well, one of these two things: short for Michal, which everyone pronounced Michael until you just gave up, or ... well, Michael.
You look around a bit. You can see more, now. You're in some sort of tomb apse. You could exit--there are exits each way--but you suspect there's some horrible maze you could easily get lost in.

You look around for secrets. First, you find two pages, one a hash of horizontal lines and another that is a hash of vertical lines. You put them together ... and you see a maze. You hope you can trace a passage out.
You do! But first, you notice, under the pages, a pair of weird mechanical eyes: sly size-slice eyes! They seem quite observant, and best, they don't seem to be surveilling YOU.
You poke around a bit, hoping for even more help. But that is all. So you follow the map, hopefully to somewhere better, or not as forbidding ...

#testcase-run-post-self-owns-rule-default
You take a step back from all the confident, constant chatter in the cell phones. You hear that, indeed, people are just repeating mantras, and they are not as smart as they think they are. You wonder if you should say something to the most egregious offenders ... and you eventually do! And they appear flustered. They attack you back for being too quiet. You mention that if they annoyed someone as too-quiet as you, they must have gone over the line.
Your confrontation did not go unnoticed by other cell phoners. They take the hint and moderate their voices.
However, now, a prize talk blasts through hidden loudspeakers. It exhorts you to find your dream, to find something that will help you move above and beyond everyone else. It's probably talking about money or power, but you're looking for something different.

Among all the chatter, you discover a disused booth. Someone is preaching on about environmental stuff, and it's so much less painful than cell phone chat. You worry they're just going to blab on forever, but they're so grateful you listened as long as you did. They hand you a stalk they think can grow quickly. Their own special formula. It looks weird and glittery, and if anything can reach up out of here, this can. But the question is, where can it grow to?

>high plain

#testcase-check-pre-high-plain-rule-fallthrough
#testcase-run-post-high-plain-rule-default
You plant the stalk, which -- well, it's already a bit of a stalk, but it grows quickly and sturdily. It's not hard at all to climb. You are pretty sure you're aboveground, but it's hard to see for sure.

The haze seemed too thick at first. But you recognize it doesn't have to be there. As you sift through it, you notice things that weren't there before. It lifts. And some of your worry lifts, too. You're not worried you might forget your name again. But perhaps you will find its significance. Not right away, but when you need to.

#testcase-run-post-pole-east-rule-default
Ah, yes. It makes sense. You find the pole. Strangely, there's just a single switch to flip. And even more strangely, the switch you flip causes the pole to revert into the ground. Yay!
But there's more! A war pawn, like a chess piece, rolls into view. It looks pretty powerful. As you take it, you reflect that you may wish to save it for down the road when you're really stuck somewhere. You have a good idea HOW to use it, at any rate.

#testcase-run-post-shore-trail-rule-default
There must be more to the short rail than you see. And you start tracing where it is, where it can be, where it should go. You find something to dig up. It's ... surprisingly malleable. You have nothing else to do, anyway. Soon it feels like pulling cable from a ground. It's tough, since you can't see around, but indeed, the short rail does lead to a shore trail that leads south.

You look at the gross tar, and you hope for a star in the sky to become brighter. It does, and clearly some of the tar is goopier than some of the other tar. You see a way to the north, and after you do, the tar isn't as relevant any more.

You look around the pillars for a key, since there's no flowerpot to hide it under. You find one, and once it unlocks the way west, you hide it, again.
You've changed the landscape a lot, north, south, east and west. But there's more! You hear a rumbling beneath you, opening a passage DOWN!

You offer to give it some of the coins it almost choked on, but it does not need them. It seems to wait around, as if to help you with travel to places you may get to go. It's willing to wait.

It's easy enough to say you should doubt yourself less. I mean, you'd feel stupid doubting it. But there's always a reason not to. Still, you involuntarily start a mantra: "Fine, doubt? Find out!"
But you need to look harder, so you mumble to yourself "Weed out wee doubt!"
With this deluge of positive self-talk, there is only one possible conclusion. You find a hideout below!

You talk with the booze troll for a bit. They seem not to know who they are, and that gives you something in common with them. They don't want to be a lousy boozer all their life. They are sick of drinking Base Ale.
You decide to trust them. They don't seem armed. You mention you've been having an adventure, and they'd sort of like one, too. They hand you a bottle of Base Ale as thanks. Not that they want you to go down their road. But it might be useful in bartering.
It looks like the new troll will be following you around. All that silence might get awkward, so you may wish to T or TALK (TO) them.

`Keep (Iller)
This keep has seen better days, but there seems to be a lot in its ruins. You can go back EAST. You also sense something fearsome from a passage south.
You are really impressed by how no mold grows here. Someone must be keeping it up well. Who?
A row (gold) shines in this otherwise forbidding keep.
There's a bunch of manic herb here. You don't know a lot about it, other than that some is really poisonous and some is okay. There's so much, perhaps it's hiding something.
A plant racker lies here, pretty much useless.
A seedy sign stands here, advertising somewhere very risky indeed.

You're surprised how just making a little shift can make the grinch earls seem much weaker. Their strength is the sort of brute force that doesn't lift other people up.
They throw down the gauntlet at this point. Don't you know cussing shows higher intelligence? Some study or other showed that!
The crude orc looks back and forth between you and the grinch earls, glaring at them a bit, but not yet ready to break free. Just a bit more, and you may gain a friend.
Your observation has caused something to "righteously" snap in the grinch earls. And boy, are they going to firehose you with their "best!"
The grinch earls snicker "Aah, slow!" at you. It's a screamy aah, not an a-ha sort of aah.

#testcase-check-pre-crew-dork-rule-fallthrough

You break the truth gently to the crude orc that, well, they're at the bottom of the totem pole for this crew. They'll use the crude orc, maybe even not let them into the clique, and then find the next sucker. The grinch earls surprisingly have little response to this besides, well, profanity.
The crude orc sees it now. The grinch earls weren't as friendly as they seemed. They wanted to use some trusting kid and corrupt them. The crude orc shakes their head. They ask if they can be seen as not just a dork.
With a bit of quick thinking (you've got experience with this by now) you say of course they don't need to feel like a dork any more. You can see how they'd be an aid orc, instead!
And thus you've gained another friend! You can stick around to torment the grinch earls further, or you can go on your way.
Hmm. You have a lot of friends following you around, but you haven't talked to them much. Perhaps you could learn something from them.

You slip in a few sly digs and say "grin, churls." They shake their heads, annoyed.
The grin churls remark that you seemed so open-minded, really, and they're all for a bit of banter, but they know when to fully move on from people like you who just don't shut up. So they do, with a "Weak wit? We quit!" and, tailing off, "We're stirred..."
But first they call in someone who they're sure can take care of you: GAWAIN KERR!
On arriving, Gawain asks you your name. "Pfft! Meeker? Oh. Mike OR. Sure ain't Mike AND, amirite?" You move to protest, but your party didn't follow you in.

Not knowing what to do, you shrug.
"Cold of you. You know, you looked like such a nice person, but after saying that, well, you proved you're a liar. Unlike me. People know I'm risque. Anyway, you don't appreciate me, so there's no use me hanging around you."

Though you were expecting a nice big ship, you get something a little humbler, namely a We-Craft Weak Raft.
And unfortunately, the "we" refers to you and your companions.
Which is just fine! Because you really did get a good deal, and it turns out to be a great bonding experience.
Once built, it seems sturdy and large enough, and it is probably way easier to operate than a Might-Anchor (My!) Tanker.

They locate a low door, then, point to where you can remove the ore to create a passage. You'll have to duck a bit to get in, but you can now go INSIDE. Hooray!

# this makes sure TREE SMALL then bringing the grow vial back works okay
The tree (small) that you summoned/discovered sits here, growing or trying to, at least. What could you use on it to help it really bloom?
But wait! You can use the grow vial! It makes the tree (small) into a tree (tall)! Then it dissolves once empty.

All this preparing food means you don't talk a bit, except for an ironic "Ache, ache, a cake!" Doing stuff for friends helps your ache go away, or at least helps you not feel it, which is life-affirming, and stuff.
But now where to eat the cake?

Wow, man! That was some good cake! Everyone shares more of their background over this meal.
The gaunt raider, in particular, has a lot to say, of past things they did that were horrible, that they think they're sorry for, but maybe not enough.
Everyone assures the raider that they're the good guys now.
You offer the gaunt raider the knife (right) as a present. They seem scared to take it, but it doesn't burst into flames when they take it, so ... it must be right for them.

The gaunt raider raises a hand. They have an idea! The abandoned mall must have all sorts of stuff that can be fashioned into weapons. Not top-of-the-line, but enough to get by. Heartened by your recent meal, your party takes the time to find weapons. You all keep them hidden until needed.

You have a clue what isle to look through. The thief isle. Thanks to your friends, especially the sneaky gnome and rogue, you avoid all sorts of traps that would've snared you on your own.
The File is well-hidden. It has to be, given the sensitive information in it. Information so sensitive, I can't detail it here, just in case someone unworthy is looking over your shoulder. But it's in your head. Trust me.
You've visited all the locations in the flier. You crumple it up as if to throw it in a trash bin. The squid makes a gesture as if it wishes to gobble the flier. You're worried it might choke on the flier, as it did for the quid, but then -- well, the water washes the paper brochure down. Odd, but hooray for clearer inventory.

You worry about how formal you need to be, but you realize perfect diction and everything can't be important. "We're meeting" is fine, but "we're meetin'" sounds a bit more welcoming.
The shrewd orc stays back until you wave them over. "Meet? Ooh! Me too?!"
It's a good meeting. You worry you're lousy at that sort of thing, but you let everyone talk, and you all have one goal in mind and each adds ideas how to get there. You all have one goal in mind. And yet you don't have a rallying cry. Perhaps it can come from within you.

Your pep talk brings everyone together. You worry it's too simplistic, especially "titan's lairs? Titan slayers!"
But everyone seems enthused, ready for what happens next. Gathering information from everyone, you start digging to find tunnels below. You clear out a passage below. You swear a solemn pact that everyone will defend everyone else, regardless of what happens.
(By the way, your speech was so stirring, it even changed the room name. Okay, I just thought the phrase was too cute to go to waste. But don't let that stop you from feeling inspirational!)

You'll probably have to alert the sea skull to your presence at some time. You try to sound authoritative when you do so. And ... well, you get its attention.
"DONE, OH?!?! DUH, NO!" it roars.
It begins pouring out rivers of blood at you and your companions. But fortunately, you have so many, that by the time it gets to you, it is not so bad. Yet it's still depressing. You think back to advice you got at the beginning ... how it seemed slightly off. What to do?

>wipe out

#testcase-check-pre-wipe-out-rule-fallthrough
#testcase-run-post-wipe-out-rule-default
You don't feel confident as you mumble "Ace, cull a skull." But you have to say something.
However, since you and your companions studied the plan tracker so well, it starts a rally! You know the taunts to give and how to deflect the skull's likely taunts. So, with a "You'd reign? You drain!" you commence combat. The skull roars back, trying to summon a tier-x T-Rex and a new clever nuke lever. You recognize those would wipe out the skull, too, so you aren't worried. "Mo' strong? Most wrong!" you fire back. You worry it's a bit redundant, but you also realize you're not in English class, here.
The skull uncovers one more machine, ominously labeled The Make-Them-Ache. Loud whirring indicates it has started up, but thinking quickly, you grasp your thumb and scream. Pronunciation pedantry for the win!
But there is real pain. And you'd be cooked if it weren't spread among your companions. They dilute the machine's effect and distract the skull. Whenever the skull focuses on one companion, the others taunt it with "Aid! Eek, a deek!" The mice have their own chant: "My, small mice maul!"
It's exhausting for you but even more exhausting for the skull, which after constant spinning eventually collapses and incinerates, but not before a self-pitying "Meek old me! Cold!"
"On ice! Aw, nice!" you proclaim, expecting big cheers.
But after all the fireworks, there's a letdown. You feel something odd come between you and your companions now you're done. They wonder why they need to do any more. You could call the whole zeitgeist a why-division.

Yes. It's time to get healing. Your companions don't have as much time or energy to help as you hoped they would, but they do enough. Everyone feels better for their part in defeating the sea skull. And yet you worry it, or something like it, may be back sooner rather than later, and your companions have gone their separate ways for good. Still, you should be pleased with yourself.
