#testcase-run-post-an-aim-rule-default
Yes. Now that you realize you want more than just to know your name, that you have bigger goals, you push a bit harder when you initially forget it. You remember patches of the past. You remember people harshly calling you by your last name, then your first.
Your name is Mike Orr. You even remember it's -- well, one of these two things: short for Michal, which everyone pronounced Michael until you just gave up, or ... well, Michael.
You look around a bit. You can see more, now. You're in some sort of tomb apse. You could exit--there are exits each way--but you suspect there's some horrible maze you could easily get lost in.

>self owns
by a point

#testcase-run-post-self-owns-rule-default
You take a step back from all the confident, constant chatter in the cell phones. You hear that, indeed, people are just repeating mantras, and they are not as smart as they think they are. You wonder if you should say something to the most egregious offenders ... and you eventually do! And they appear flustered. They attack you back for being too quiet. You mention that if they annoyed someone as too-quiet as you, they must have gone over the line.
Your confrontation did not go unnoticed by other cell phoners. They take the hint and moderate their voices.
However, now, a prize talk blasts through hidden loudspeakers. It exhorts you to find your dream, to find something that will help you move above and beyond everyone else. It's probably talking about money or power, but you're looking for something different.

>pry stalk
by a point

#testcase-run-post-pry-stalk-rule-default
Among all the chatter, you discover a disused booth. Someone is preaching on about environmental stuff, and it's so much less painful than cell phone chat. You worry they're just going to blab on forever, but they're so grateful you listened as long as you did. They hand you a stalk they think can grow quickly. Their own special formula. It looks weird and glittery, and if anything can reach up out of here, this can. But the question is, where can it grow to?

>high plain
by a point

#testcase-run-post-high-plain-rule-default
You plant the stalk, which -- well, it's already a bit of a stalk, but it grows quickly and sturdily. It's not hard at all to climb. You are pretty sure you're aboveground, but it's hard to see for sure.

#testcase-room-names-naff-haze
`Naff Haze

>nah phase
by a point

#testcase-run-post-nah-phase-rule-default
The haze seemed too thick at first. But you recognize it doesn't have to be there. As you sift through it, you notice things that weren't there before. It lifts.

#+testcase-room-names-naff-haze
`High Plain

>pole east
by a point

#testcase-run-post-pole-east-rule-default
Ah, yes. It makes sense. You find the pole. Strangely, there's just a single switch to flip. And even more strangely, the switch you flip causes the pole to revert into the ground. Yay!
But there's more! A war pawn, like a chess piece, rolls into view. It looks pretty powerful. Maybe you see how to use it, but maybe you shouldn't use it right away.

>shore trail
by a point

#testcase-run-post-shore-trail-rule-default
There must be more to the short rail than you see. And you start tracing where it is, where it can be, where it should go. You find something to dig up. It's ... surprisingly malleable. You have nothing else to do, anyway. Soon it feels like pulling cable from a ground. It's tough, since you can't see around, but indeed, the short rail does lead to a shore trail that leads south.

>grow star
by a point

#testcase-run-post-grow-star-rule-default
You look at the gross tar, and you hope for a star in the sky to become brighter. It does, and clearly some of the tar is goopier than some of the other tar. You see a way to the north, and after you do, the tar isn't as relevant any more.

>key pillar
by a point

#testcase-run-post-key-pillar-rule-default
You look around the pillars for a key, since there's no flowerpot to hide it under. You find one, and you open the way west.
You've changed the landscape a lot, north, south, east and west. But there's more! You hear a rumbling beneath you, opening a passage DOWN!

`No Notion

>known ocean
by a point

#testcase-run-post-known-ocean-rule-default
Ah, yes. Things clear up a bit now. There we go ... you see where an ocean should be, and ... yes, you dip your toe in some wetness. Things clear up. You even see a sick squid! Maybe you can help it.

#+testcase-room-names-no-notion
`Known Ocean

>six quid
by a point

#testcase-run-post-six-quid-rule-default
You have an idea what is bothering the squid. Yes, a few coins stuck. Surprisingly, it lets you help out. "Current, sea, currency," you mutter as you poke around. Ah, there you go.
You offer to give it some of the coins it almost choked on, but it does not need them. It seems to wait around, as if to help you with travel to places you may get to go. It's willing to wait.

Yes. It's time to get healing. Your companions don't have as much time or energy to help as you hoped they would, but they do enough. Everyone feels better for their part in defeating the sea skull. And yet you worry it, or something like it, may be back sooner rather than later, and your companions have gone their separate ways for good. Still, you should be pleased with yourself.
