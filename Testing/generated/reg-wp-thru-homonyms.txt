>my core
You always want to strengthen your own core, but you have a feeling you're looking too inward, here. Though you must be close.

Hmm. You need someone much more active than that. Someone who can help with rebellion, not just whine about things that are wrong.

#+testcase-homonym-detail-hom-gaunt-raider-rule-if-the-player's-command-includes-trader

Knowing a trader might be useful, but given you don't want to deal with guns, maybe you should try and find another side to the gone traitor.

You don't owe the oaf liar anything, and they don't owe you a flier, even if they might be wasting your time. How to call attention to a flier, though?
