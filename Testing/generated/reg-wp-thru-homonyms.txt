#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-my-core-rule-default
>my core
You always want to strengthen your own core, but you have a feeling you're looking too inward, here. Though you must be close.

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-nah-phaze-rule-default

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-rouge-old-rule-default
>rogue old
Rouge ... no, too foreign, also, too abstract. But you need a person, not a color. That'll get you a point in this game, not just Canadian football.

>rogue old
by a point

>plan tracker

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-c-sea-design-rule-default
>sea design
Close, but there are other waterways. Action (well, sort of) is needed here.

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-mencsh-elf-rule-if-the-player's-command-includes-munch
>munch elf
No, a sort of person. This one's a bit obscure.

#+testcase-homonym-detail-hom-mencsh-elf-rule-if-the-player's-command-includes-munch
>mensh elf
Oh, man. Sorry to be playing spelling police with you here, but you have the pronunciation right.

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-wheel-own-rule-default
>wheel own
This is a seedy financial services provider, not a seedy used car dealer. Still, you must be on the right track.

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-bile-owe-rule-default
>bile owe
Neither you nor the merchant owe each other anything, for better or for worse. You're close. Perhaps you should just see things as they are and emote slightly.

>bile oh
by a point

>whee lone
by a point

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-owe-flier-rule-default
>owe flier
You don't owe the oaf liar anything, and they don't owe you a flier, even if they might be wasting your time. How to call attention to a flier, though?

You do not have any magic points, so you don't need them refreshed. But you must be close!

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-whirr-meetin-rule-if-the-player's-command-includes-whirr
>whirr meetin
Close, but you don't need a whirr noise.

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-whirr-meetin-rule-if-the-player's-command-includes-whirr
>warm meetin
You don't need to change this place's complexion here. It's cozy, a place for people to be together. But how?

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-cease-cull-rule-default
>seize cull
No, seizing is the last thing you want the skull to do. And you aren't foolish enough to want to seize power.
