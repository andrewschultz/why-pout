>my core
You always want to strengthen your own core, but you have a feeling you're looking too inward, here. Though you must be close.

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-rouge-old-rule-default
>rouge old
Rouge ... no, too foreign, also, too abstract. But you need a person, not a color. That'll get you a point in this game, not just Canadian football.

The grin churls remark that you seemed so nice, really, and they're all for a bit of banter, but they know when to fully move on from people like you who just don't shut up.

No, a sort of person. This one's a bit obscure.

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-wheel-own-rule-default

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-bile-owe-rule-default

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-owe-flier-rule-default
>owe flier
You don't owe the oaf liar anything, and they don't owe you a flier, even if they might be wasting your time. How to call attention to a flier, though?
