#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-my-core-rule-default
>my core
You always want to strengthen your own core, but you have a feeling you're looking too inward, here. Though you must be close.

You need to do more than greet the desired location. Describe it.

#+testcase-homonym-detail-hom-hi-playin-rule-if-the-player's-command-includes-hi

No playin'. What is this location, specifically?

#testcase-homonym-reject-table-of-main-oronyms-rouge-hom-rouge-old-rule
#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-rouge-old-rule-default
>rouge old
Rouge ... no, too foreign, also, too abstract. But you need a person, not a color. That'll get you a point in this game, not just Canadian football.

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-wheel-own-rule-default

#testcase-homonym-reject-table-of-main-oronyms-owe-hom-bile-owe-rule
#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-bile-owe-rule-default
>bile owe
Neither you nor the merchant owe each other anything, for better or for worse. You're close. Perhaps you should just see things as they are and emote slightly.

You don't owe the oaf liar anything, and they don't owe you a flier, even if they might be wasting your time. How to call attention to a flier, though?

You do not have any magic points, so you don't need them refreshed. But you must be close! Like, just one letter off!

#+testcase-homonym-detail-hom-whirr-meetin-rule-else-if-the-player's-command-includes-whirr
>warm meetin
You don't need to change this place's complexion here. It's cozy, a place for people to be together. But how?

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-whirr-meetin-rule-if-the-player's-command-includes-meeting

That sounds a bit too informal and serious. Especially since the room has no ending g.

You don't need to see more seas. In fact, you need things to settle down.

#testcase-homonym-detail-hom-cease-cull-rule-if-the-player's-command-includes-seize
>seize cull
No, seizing is the last thing you want the skull to do. And you aren't foolish enough to want to seize power.
