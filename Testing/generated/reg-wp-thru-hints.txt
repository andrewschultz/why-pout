#apocryphal test case
>eye me
You're stuck with what to do right now. Perhaps you can use your senses for clues, or THINK, or look inward with X ME, to give you an idea of how to get started. Not just a what, but a how or a why.

>purloin eyes
>eye me
The eyes light up green and show two dots, then three dots.

>eye
The eyes almost seem to light up. Perhaps you need to change something with yourself later, when things are noticeably different.

The eyes light up yellow and show two dots, then five dots.
NOTE: while the number of dots on the eyes is the main thing, they also have two binary settings: green or yellow, and glowing or dimly glowing. EYE EYES will walk you through what the eyes' different outputs mean.
NOTE: the yellow dots mean something unusual. You can EYE EYES to pin down what, if you don't want to guess.

>eye eye
!The eyes light
The eyes will light up two sets of dots if there is something you still need to do in the area. (1/6, EYE EYES again (or G repeats a command) to see more)

>eye eye
The numbers of dots correspond to the number of letters in the first and second words to type, respectively. (2/6)

>eye eye
The dots also have two different types of appearances that clue you to the puzzle nature: green or yellow, and dimly glowing or glowing. (3/6)

>eye eye
Green dots mean the suggested action can score a point right now. (4/6)

>eye eye
Yellow dots mean you have something to guess, but you won't get a point, as you haven't found the right items or assistance from other puzzles to make things work. A successful guess will be kept in THINK. (5/6)

>eye eye
Finally, a dimly glowing reading indicates something you can change for a bonus point. It's not critical to complete Why Pout. (End of hints. Next EYE EYES starts the hint cycle again) (6/6)

>eye eye
The eyes will light up two sets of dots if there is something you still need to do in the area. (1/6)
