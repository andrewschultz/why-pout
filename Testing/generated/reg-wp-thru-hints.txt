You're stuck with what to do right now. Perhaps you can use your senses for clues, or THINK, or look inward, to give you an idea of how to get started. Not just a what, but a how or a why. You can't exactly look outward.

>purloin eyes

The eyes light up green and show two dots, then three dots.

>eye
The eyes almost seem to light up. Perhaps you need to do something later with the general area, though specific things may provide a clue, when things are noticeably different.

The eyes light up yellow and show two dots, then five dots.
[NOTE: the eyes have two binary settings: green or yellow, and glowing or dimly glowing. This, along with the hints, may be intuitive, but if it is not, EYE EYES will spell things out.]

!The eyes light
The eyes will light up two sets of dots if there is something relevant to clue. (+)

>eye eye
The numbers of dots correspond to the number of letters in each word. (+)

>eye eye
The dots also have two binary settings: green or yellow, and dimly glowing or glowing. (+)

>eye eye
Green dots mean something you can move forward with now. (+)

>eye eye
Yellow dots mean something you can guess, but you don't have the right items or assistance to move forward. (+)

>eye eye
Finally, a dimly glowing reading is something that is optional for completing Why Pout. (End of hints. Next EYE EYES starts the hint cycle again)
