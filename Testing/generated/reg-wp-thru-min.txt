Coming back here, you notice BRUISE-WARES has vanished. But that can't be all bad. It means one less potential place to need to look, if you get a bit lost.

Ah! Good job! You've found the secret command to REALLY get rid of the war pawn. Sadly, this won't get you a bonus point, since you already used the pawn. Of course, you won't be able to use the pawn after this. Ditch the pawn?
Okay. No warning next time.
The war pawn jumps out of your hand and down to the ground with a perfect feet-first landing. It salutes you and then runs off, taking occasional diagonal jumps to gobble up vulnerable ants and insects.
NOTE: this would have scored a point if you hadn't used the war pawn. It was intended as a tricky bonus point across games. Nice job finding it!

All but one bonus point is found in Bruise Wares.
You managed to say NOPE ON to the war pawn, but you'd already used it, so you didn't get the bonus point.
