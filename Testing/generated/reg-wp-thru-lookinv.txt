* main-thru

The air chokes you a bit. It's too thick to see far beyond yourself. You barely know who you are, even. Ugh. You can't see much beyond yourself, really, so that'd be somewhere to start.

It's a bit clearer now. You still seem trapped. But there must be secrets hidden, and maybe one or more can get you out of here.

>two maps

>l
Hype Lane
It's still pretty dark here. You must still be underground.
Around you, cell phones, cell phones everywhere. Such confident chatter. Or it seems confident. It distracts you and your bearings, trying to figure who you really are and get somewhere less dark.
You don't remember everything about your former self, but you remember you hated cell phones and how they distracted you. Maybe if the people yacking into them were taken down a peg, you could focus a bit more. Dang cell phones.

>self owns
by a point

>l
It's still pretty dark here. You must still be underground.
Around you, a prize talk booms from unseen speakers, exhorting you to do, or at least earn, more. The heck with being above ground, with boring old nature that distracts you from being all you can be. Well, for the economy, at least.
You'd like to DO something about the prize talk. Or seek out something that would give you passage away from it.

>pry stalk
by a point

INVENTORY CHANGED
There's that occasional voice ringing in your head asking "Why pout?" But besides that ...
You are carrying:
  a stalk
You have a name, too, now, you remember: Mike Orr.

>l
Hype Lane
The prize talk is all around, but you're able to ignore it, now you feel you might have a way out.

>high plain
by a point

INVENTORY CHANGED
There's that occasional voice ringing in your head asking "Why pout?" Well, you're feeling a bit alone, but there's always the prospect of finding stuff...
"Good! Some goods, umm...":
some sly size-slice eyes
You have a name, too, now, you remember: Mike Orr.
!/^..a stalk

You're surrounded by some really naff haze. It's naff because you can't go anywhere, and it also just makes you feel naff, and it seems so universal, like there's no escaping from it.

>nah phase
by a point

Things have opened up to where you see potential paths now, with the naff haze lifted.
A keep, iller, rises to the WEST, but you see no way in.
Gross tar blocks the way NORTH into darkness.
A short rail leads -- well, not very far. You get the sense it should lead somewhere more.
You feel policed here. And it's the mean American gung-ho militarized sort of policed, not the (usually) kinder UK brand. Where and what is this policed feeling coming from?

>pole east
by a point

A war pawn, like a chess piece, rolls into view. It looks pretty powerful. As you take it, you reflect that you may wish to save it for down the road when you're really stuck somewhere.
There's that occasional voice ringing in your head asking "Why pout?" Well, you're feeling a bit alone, but there's always the prospect of finding stuff...
"Good! Some goods, umm...":
  a war pawn
Also, you almost forgot you forgot your name, Mike Orr, at first. Maybe you will find something special about it some day.

>grow star

You got rid of the gross tar blocking your way NORTH.
!way DOWN
Things have opened up almost all the way now, with the naff haze lifted. You feel less policed, too, since you found a path EAST.

>key pillar

>l
A keep, iller, rises to the WEST, and you figured how to enter it.
!but you see no way in
There's also a way DOWN that opened up once you found passages in all cardinal directions.

A row (gold) shines in this otherwise forbidding keep. You've met its proprietor, the rogue (old,) but they require payment

You simply have no notion what lies beyond here. You hope something does. Surely the shore trail didn't just lead to a dead end! You can go back north to the high plain.

>known ocean
by a point

#testcase-isledescription-0-without-guess
>l
It looks like there is an ocean, or some large body of water, as you can't see islands in the distance. If they're there, they're too far to swim to.

>six quid
by a point

>i
You have six quid from helping the sick squid.

>n

>n

A big rock in the shape of a wolf looms impressively, blocking all passages except back SOUTH. Also, the high doubt you can go anywhere else here is thick indeed. Maybe there's a way to dispel it.
There's a huge pile of lode ore here, too, and perhaps there's something in it.

>wool frock
by a point

You rummage about and find a wool frock.

You can only go back UP. It wouldn't be a very good hideout if you had too many places to sneak around.
A booze troll sulks sullenly here.

INVENTORY CHANGED
There's that occasional voice ringing in your head asking "Why pout?" It's a bit harder to than before, because you have a companion now, the new troll.

A row (gold) shines in this otherwise forbidding keep, and you're glad the rogue (old) had enough faith in you to leave it for a while.

>see design
by a point

Whatever you need to do or find here, you only want to do it once. You don't want to have to come back. You're glad your friends supported you enough to get here, but you don't want to have to rely on them like that again.
So, what do you need to find, before getting out?

!A seedy sign stands

Worm-Eaten
This place seems very run-down. But it feels homey and inspires camaraderie in an odd way.
Someone comes out from the depths. They introduce themselves as the gone traitor, someone who cozied up to the bad guys and ditched their friends, then ditched the bad guys. And only recently they ran away, but how can they ask for forgiveness? Surely it just doesn't happen like this? Just one small change and you have a new identity? Rubbish!

The gone traitor continues to mope about here, looking for someone who can help convince them they're not so awful.

An ominous new construction appears here. It's called BRUISE-WARES. Perhaps you should ignore it. Often one doesn't want to engage that sort of thing. But you may feel that much more accomplished tackling whatever is behind there.

>l
BRUISE-WARES, some sort of odd disturbing shop, has popped up here. You can probably figure why it's forbidding and such. But perhaps it is only for a certain sort of adventurer.

Your companions stay behind. They recognize this is a spiritual fight for you and you alone.
Brew Swears
If you thought Hype Lane was bad, this is even worse. You can leave back OUT.
Some grinch earls parade around here, bragging about how they ruin boring people's fun with their dynamic ways and pointing out that it's easy to be nice if you're boring. They fix you with a "We parse: weep, arse" gaze. They constantly blather "WE CUSS" and seem quite proud of that.
A crude orc trundles around here, trying to impress the grinch earls.

Lobe End
This lobe of land appears to fall off steeply in all directions except back west. Maybe you could look for something that might be a hill, even a steep one.

>low bend
by a point

>l
The low bend (former lobe end) now bends from west to north, where there's too much water to pass on foot. So maybe you could get across, with transport. Maybe you can summon or find someone who can offer it, as well a way to pay.

Well, you're in a sort of shopping mall now. You can see a passage leading north.
A MEN shelf sits here, barren. Which may be a good thing--there's no appalling stuff to buy. Or a bad thing--everything it displayed was in such high demand.
A stall labeled MY STALL sits here, abandoned, against a wall. You think you hear odd noises from behind it.

This area feels replete with the sort of double-talk all salesmen use. You can almost hear all the dropped and excess apostrophes. It will be tough to hang with all the way through, but if you do, maybe you'll get something out of it.
So, yeah, outwardly, everything seems okay here. And yet ... something about the place, its name, leads you to feel things behind the curtain aren't right, and you need to expose them.
You can only go back OUT here.
You don't really trust the whole "financial services" vibe here. Maybe there's a double meaning to deduce.
