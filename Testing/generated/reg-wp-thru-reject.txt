>an aim
by a point

#testcase-check-pre-an-aim-rule-fallthrough
Yes. Now that you realize you want more than just to know your name, that you have bigger goals, you push a bit harder when you initially forget it. You remember patches of the past. You remember people harshly calling you by your last name, then your first.
Your name is Mike Orr. You even remember it's -- well, one of these two things: short for Michal, which everyone pronounced Michael until you just gave up, or ... well, Michael.
You look around a bit. You can see more, now. You're in some sort of tomb apse. You could exit--there are exits each way--but you suspect there's some horrible maze you could easily get lost in.

#testcase-check-pre-wipe-out-rule-if-pals-made-is-0
>wipe out
You aren't feeling too great, but you don't want or need to wipe yourself out, yet. Perhaps you can find the root of your problems and wipe it out one day, though.

>my corps
Sadly, you have no friends to bring together yet! Yet.

#testcase-think-table-of-main-oronyms-pre-wipe-out-rule
>think
You will want to WIPE OUT the cause of your problems once you have them in your crosshairs. That's probably not for a while, though.

That would be a nicer place! But you have nothing that could help you move up yet. You'll have to observe the general area a bit more.

>high plain
That would be a nicer place! But you have nothing that could help you move up yet. You'll have to observe the general area a bit more.
Hmph. That still doesn't quite work! You'll figure out the how and when and where, though.

>self owns
by a point

#testcase-check-pre-self-owns-rule-fallthrough
You take a step back from all the confident, constant chatter in the cell phones. You hear that, indeed, people are just repeating mantras, and they are not as smart as they think they are. You wonder if you should say something to the most egregious offenders ... and you eventually do! And they appear flustered. They attack you back for being too quiet. You mention that if they annoyed someone as too-quiet as you, they must have gone over the line.
Your confrontation did not go unnoticed by other cell phoners. They take the hint and moderate their voices.
However, now, a prize talk blasts through hidden loudspeakers. It exhorts you to find your dream, to find something that will help you move above and beyond everyone else. It's probably talking about money or power, but you're looking for something different.

>pry stalk
by a point

#testcase-check-pre-pry-stalk-rule-fallthrough
Among all the chatter, you discover a disused booth. Someone is preaching on about environmental stuff, and it's so much less painful than cell phone chat. You worry they're just going to blab on forever, but they're so grateful you listened as long as you did. They hand you a stalk they think can grow quickly. Their own special formula. It looks weird and glittery, and if anything can reach up out of here, this can. But the question is, where can it grow to?

>high plain
by a point

#testcase-check-pre-high-plain-rule-fallthrough
You plant the stalk, which -- well, it's already a bit of a stalk, but it grows quickly and sturdily. It's not hard at all to climb. You are pretty sure you're aboveground, but it's hard to see for sure.

>nah phase
by a point

#testcase-check-pre-nah-phase-rule-fallthrough
The haze seemed too thick at first. But you recognize it doesn't have to be there. As you sift through it, you notice things that weren't there before. It lifts.

>pole east
by a point

#testcase-check-pre-pole-east-rule-fallthrough
Ah, yes. It makes sense. You find the pole. Strangely, there's just a single switch to flip. And even more strangely, the switch you flip causes the pole to revert into the ground. Yay!
But there's more! A war pawn, like a chess piece, rolls into view. It looks pretty powerful. Maybe you see how to use it, but maybe you shouldn't use it right away.

>shore trail
by a point

#testcase-check-pre-shore-trail-rule-fallthrough
There must be more to the short rail than you see. And you start tracing where it is, where it can be, where it should go. You find something to dig up. It's ... surprisingly malleable. You have nothing else to do, anyway. Soon it feels like pulling cable from a ground. It's tough, since you can't see around, but indeed, the short rail does lead to a shore trail that leads south.

>grow star
by a point

#testcase-check-pre-grow-star-rule-fallthrough
You look at the gross tar, and you hope for a star in the sky to become brighter. It does, and clearly some of the tar is goopier than some of the other tar. You see a way to the north, and after you do, the tar isn't as relevant any more.

>key pillar
by a point

#testcase-check-pre-key-pillar-rule-fallthrough
You look around the pillars for a key, since there's no flowerpot to hide it under. You find one, and you open the way west.
You've changed the landscape a lot, north, south, east and west. But there's more! You hear a rumbling beneath you, opening a passage DOWN!

#testcase-check-pre-key-pillar-rule-if-sco-key-pillar-is-true
>key pillar
You already opened the keep (iller)!

>w

>gnome old
You summon a gnome, old, to compliment them on keeping the keep looking so nice all these years. They thank you but mention they're a bit sick of it and they seek adventure. Yet they can't go adventuring in these tatty clothes.

>rogue old
A rogue, old, appears, but after some conversation, you realize you don't have any money to pay them with. They'd like to help, but they worked for free once and felt ripped off. Maybe later.

>manna curb
Perhaps there is a lot of good stuff beneath the manic herb, but you don't have the specialized knowledge to figure it out.

>see design
