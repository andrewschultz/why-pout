>wipe out
You aren't feeling too great, but you don't want or need to wipe yourself out, yet. Perhaps you can find the root of your problems and wipe it out one day, though.

>my corps
Sadly, you have no friends to bring together yet! Yet.

#testcase-think-table-of-main-oronyms-pre-wipe-out-rule
>think
You will want to WIPE OUT the cause of your problems once you have them in your crosshairs. That's probably not for a while, though.

The grin churls remark that you seemed so nice, really, and they're all for a bit of banter, but they know when to fully move on from people like you who just don't shut up.

>wide vision
You try to declare a wide vision, but as you do, you trip yourself up on pronunciation. Wide vision? Why division? You worry you haven't fought through enough to have a truly wide vision--sure, you solved all the puzzles you needed to, but you feel like you're missing some necessary experience and struggle you need for true, long-term leadership.

>wide vision
You are unable to express your wide vision. You'll have to settle for just repairing things pretty well.

#testcase-think-table-of-main-oronyms-pre-wide-vision-rule
>think
Sadly, you didn't quite experience enough to spread your wide vision.

>wipe out
You already wiped out the sea skull! Now is the time for healing.
