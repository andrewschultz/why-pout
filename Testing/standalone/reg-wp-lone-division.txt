Your experiences and failures give you a leadership you don't know you had. You convince your companions to do more than just save their own hides. You lay out a vision so scourges from the likes of the sea skull are less likely to happen again, or it will take longer. And everyone listens! A few even say "Worth inking, we're thinking!"
They're eager for the final step, to get out there. You look around. It's pretty clear what must occur, or it will be, soon.

>t raider
You've already shared your vision. Now's the time to put it into action.

!bonus point
You try to declare a wide vision, but as you do, you trip yourself up on pronunciation. Wide vision? Why division? You worry you haven't fought through enough to have a truly wide vision--sure, you solved all the puzzles you needed to, but you feel like you're missing some necessary experience and struggle you need for true, long-term leadership.
You make your sales pitch for more than just saving one's own skin. And it's more than a sales pitch! You try not to worry whether you have a captive audience, and you don't, until -- one small glib slip, where you were pretty sure you had to be right, but you weren't. Ouch. Your companions say there's nobody else they'd rather have lead them. Why, they look up to you almost as much as their parents! It hurts them to move on. And the issue is finely balanced. But they'll need to, with things done here. They'll take this lesson back to their villages, or wherever. Honest they will!

You discuss your journey and its ups and downs. It seems like you have just about everyone on board. They want to put their doubts aside, but for whatever reason, they just can't quite go along with you.

You're pretty good with words. (You had to be, to make it this far.) You learned what to say, and then you learned when and how. But you haven't quite learned enough to persuade your companions your leadership should carry over.

While you often ran into situations where you felt unprepared, and there was a good deal of temporary failure along the way, you wound up seeing and feeling nothing crushing from all this delay and distraction. So you don't communicate your vision of growth all that well.

You come off as someone who just glided through things, knowing exactly what to do, when and where, encountering little, if any, REAL adversity. Surely, your companions muse, you'll be able to get the whole leadership thing right without them! It stings a bit.
You ask for credit because you didn't use the war pawn, but that seems irrelevant. They didn't know you had one!
"It was BRUISE-WARES, wasn't it?" you ask. "I shouldn't have ignored it."
