The war pawn rattles briefly in your hand, like it means to do something, but it's not ready. Or maybe you aren't. Yet.

The war pawn seems to warm up very briefly. Perhaps there's a bit left to do here, but that may be a way down the road.

It's been vandalized a bit, though, and maybe if you X again, you might find a fourth-wall way to warp around and, well, see the bare minimum of extra adventures it holds, without the, well, language.
!Oh, hey
>x bruise
Oh, hey! You notice something scrawled on BRUISE-WARES. It says NAH, BYE. It seems negative on the surface but makes you believe if you can do the minimum you need to get in and out of that place and bypass the spicier stuff.

Allowing you to undo using the war pawn is a bit too much of a loophole. There's a walkthrough. Or you can save and restore a lot before warping.
