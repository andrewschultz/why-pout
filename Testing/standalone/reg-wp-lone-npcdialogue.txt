NOTE: the dialogue text will now cycle. You missed seven random additional chats, because you didn't have the orc along for it all, which is why no dialogue showed up every four turns. You hadn't gotten one member in the selected random companion pairs to join. If you want to see/revisit all this without a long re-playthrough, it's in Why Pout Random Text.i7x at http://github.com/andrewschultz/why-pout. I hope you enjoyed it, whether you just typed Z a lot or were adventuring through it all.

NOTE: the dialogue text will now cycle. You saw about three-quarters of the random additional chats, because you didn't find an additional optional companion.
