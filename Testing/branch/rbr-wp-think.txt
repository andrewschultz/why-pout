You try to declare a wide vision, but as you do, you trip yourself up on pronunciation. Wide vision? Why division? You worry you haven't fought through enough to have a truly wide vision--sure, you solved all the puzzles you needed to, but you feel like you're missing some necessary experience and struggle you need for true, long-term leadership.

Your experiences and failures give you a leadership you don't know you had. You convince your companions to do more than just save their own hides. You lay out a vision so scourges from the likes of the sea skull are less likely to happen again, or it will take longer. And everyone listens! A few even say "Worth inking, we're thinking!"
They're eager for the final step, to get out there. You look around. It's pretty clear what must occur, or it will be, soon.
