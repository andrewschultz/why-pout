Like most of my games, Why Pout rates merciful on the Zarfian cruelty scale. However, in this case, I want the puzzles to be more merciful in terms of general difficulty on the player's psyche than usual.
Note that an optional room will appear about midway through the game. It may contain profanity, which I hope is amusing, but I don't blame you if you wish to skip it.
blurglecruncheon@gmail.com is my email, and http://github.com/andrewschultz/why-pout is the github site, where you can report issues. I'm open to transcripts.
CREDITS lists people who helped make Why Pout a reality, or a better version than it would've been without them.  EXT shows the extensions listed, and VERSION or VERSIONS shows version info.

Yes. Now that you realize you want more than just to know your name, that you have bigger goals, you push a bit harder when you initially forget it. You remember patches of the past. You remember people harshly calling you by your last name, then your first.
Your name is Mike Orr. You even remember it's -- well, one of these two things: short for Michal, which everyone pronounced Michael until you just gave up, or ... well, Michael.
You look around a bit. You can see more, now. You're in some sort of tomb apse. You could exit--there are exits each way--but you suspect there's some horrible maze you could easily get lost in.

You look around for secrets. First, you find two pages, one a hash of horizontal lines and another that is a hash of vertical lines. You put them together ... and you see a maze. You hope you can trace a passage out.
You do! But first, you notice, under the pages, a pair of weird mechanical eyes: sly size-slice eyes! They seem quite observant, and best, they don't seem to be surveilling YOU.
You poke around a bit, hoping for even more help. But that is all. So you follow the map, hopefully to somewhere better, or not as forbidding ...

You take a step back from all the confident, constant chatter in the cell phones. You hear that, indeed, people are just repeating mantras, and they are not as smart as they think they are. You wonder if you should say something to the most egregious offenders ... and you eventually do! And they appear flustered. They attack you back for being too quiet. You mention that if they annoyed someone as too-quiet as you, they must have gone over the line.
Your confrontation did not go unnoticed by other cell phoners. They take the hint and moderate their voices.
However, now, a prize talk blasts through hidden loudspeakers. It exhorts you to find your dream, to find something that will help you move above and beyond everyone else. It's probably talking about money or power, but you're looking for something different.

Among all the chatter, you discover a disused booth. Someone is preaching on about environmental stuff, and it's so much less painful than cell phone chat. You worry they're just going to blab on forever, but they're so grateful you listened as long as you did. They hand you a stalk they think can grow quickly. Their own special formula. It looks weird and glittery, and if anything can reach up out of here, this can. But the question is, where can it grow to?

You're surprised how just making a little shift can make the grinch earls seem much weaker. Their strength is the sort of brute force that doesn't lift other people up.
They throw down the gauntlet at this point. Don't you know cussing shows higher intelligence? Some study or other showed that!
The crude orc looks back and forth between you and the grinch earls, glaring at them a bit, but not yet ready to break free. Just a bit more, and you may gain a friend.

You break the truth gently to the crude orc that, well, they're at the bottom of the totem pole for this crew. They'll use the crude orc, maybe even not let them into the clique, and then find the next sucker. The grinch earls surprisingly have little response to this besides, well, profanity.
The crude orc sees it now. The grinch earls weren't as friendly as they seemed. They wanted to use some trusting kid and corrupt them. The crude orc shakes their head. They ask if they can be seen as not just a dirk.
With a bit of quick thinking (you've got experience with this by now) you say of course they don't need to feel like a dork any more. You can see how they'd be an aid orc, instead!
And thus you've gained another friend! You can stick around to torment the grinch earls further, or you can go on your way.

Which is just fine! Because you really did get a good deal, and it turns out to be a great bonding experience.

You think up a summer chant you mumble under your breath. The merchant finds it a bit weird you like THAT as a way to keep positive. It doesn't seem like that sort of thing helps the economy. Their cheeriness slips slightly, with impressively-balanced potshots at people more and less successful than they are.

The mere suggestion that the merchant's aggression may be annoying seems to set them off. No, no, it's people like YOU who are the problem. Without dynamic positivity like theirs, you're totally screwed! You're just jealous you don't have it!
You freeze up, confused by all this, and the merchant takes this as a sign of arrogant disrespect. You are not the first person to reject their positivity! They run into clueless crumb-bums all day!
They storm off, presumably to find another crumb-bum to abuse for not having their brand of positivity.

You act distracted just right. The oaf liar tries to get your attention. Just ignoring them wouldn't work, but paying attention to a flier ... well, they take the hint that you aren't a high-rolling customer. They try to wheedle more money out of you, but of course, that's all you have. So you trade your final quid for the flier. The oaf liar thanks you for not totally wasting their time. They seem to snicker as they depart.
This transaction reduces your wealth from one quid to zero quid.

The gaunt raider raises a hand. They have an idea! The abandoned mall must have all sorts of stuff that can be fashioned into weapons. Not top-of-the-line, but enough to get by. Heartened by your recent meal, your party takes the time to find weapons. You all keep them hidden until needed.

You have a clue what isle to look through. The thief isle. Thanks to your friends, especially the sneaky gnome and rogue, you avoid all sorts of traps that would've snared you on your own.
Congratulations. You now possess, not just any file, but The File.
You've visited all the locations in the flier. You crumple it up as if to throw it in a trash bin. The squid makes a gesture as if it wishes to gobble the flier. You're worried it might choke on the flier, as it did for the quid, but then -- well, the water washes the paper brochure down. Odd, but hooray for clearer inventory.

Your pep talk brings everyone together. You worry it's too simplistic, especially "titan's lairs? Titan slayers!"
But everyone seems enthused, ready for what happens next. Gathering information from everyone, you start digging to find tunnels below. You clear out a passage below. You swear a solemn pact that everyone will defend everyone else, regardless of what happens.
(By the way, your speech was so stirring, it even changed the room name. Okay, I just thought the phrase was too cute to go to waste. But don't let that stop you from feeling inspirational!)

You'll probably have to alert the sea skull to your presence at some time. You try to sound authoritative when you do so. And ... well, you get its attention.
"DONE, OH?!?! DUH, NO!" it roars.
It begins pouring out rivers of blood at you and your companions. But fortunately, you have so many, that by the time it gets to you, it is not so bad. Yet it's still depressing. You think back to advice you got at the beginning ... how it seemed slightly off. What to do?

@all

Easier said than done, but since you all studied the plan tracker so well, it isn't impossible!
Your makeshift weapons are just enough to distract the sea skull. It starts to focus on one party member, then the others taunt it with "Aid! Eek, a deek!"
It's exhausting for you but even more exhausting for the skull, which after constant spinning eventually collapses and incinerates, but not before a self-pitying "Meek old me! Cold!"
But after all the fireworks, there's a letdown. You feel something odd come between you and your companions now you're done. They wonder why they need to do any more. You could call the whole zeitgeist a why-division.

Yes. It's time to get healing. Your companions don't have as much time or energy to help as you hoped they would, but they do enough. Everyone feels better for their part in defeating the sea skull. And yet you worry it, or something like it, may be back sooner rather than later, and your companions have gone their separate ways for good. Still, you should be pleased with yourself.
