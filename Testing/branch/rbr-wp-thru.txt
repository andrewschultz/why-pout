}$REJECT1=You're stuck with what to do right now. Perhaps you can use your senses for clues, or THINK, or look inward, to give you an idea of how to get started. Not just a what, but a how or a why. You can't exactly look outward.
}$REJECT2=That thought/action/observation/request brings up nothing. Why Pout has a limited set of verbs, and the main thing is to guess a two-word phrase. To see what verbs are used, try VERBS.

Neither you nor the merchant owe each other anything, for better or for worse. You're close. Perhaps you should just see things as they are and emote slightly.

You're not in the mood for exploring the wharf. It seems like a good way to get lost. Maybe there's someone or something nearby you can pick up, then leave.

>wide vision
You try to declare a wide vision, but as you do, you trip yourself up on pronunciation. Wide vision? Why division? You worry you haven't fought through enough to have a truly wide vision--sure, you solved all the puzzles you needed to, but you feel like you're missing some necessary experience and struggle you need for true, long-term leadership.

You are unable to express your wide vision. You'll have to settle for just repairing things pretty well.
