}$REJECT1=You're stuck with what to do right now. Perhaps you can use your senses for clues, or THINK, or look inward, to give you an idea of how to get started. Not just a what, but a how or a why. You can't exactly look outward.
}$REJECT2=That thought/action/observation/request brings up nothing. Why Pout has a limited set of verbs, and the main thing is to guess a two-word phrase. To see what verbs are used, try VERBS.
}$REJHOM=Hmm. That really, really SOUNDED like it should work, but it didn't.

Yes. Now that you realize you want more than just to know your name, that you have bigger goals, you push a bit harder when you initially forget it. You remember patches of the past. You remember people harshly calling you by your last name, then your first.
Your name is Mike Orr. You even remember it's -- well, one of these two things: short for Michal, which everyone pronounced Michael until you just gave up, or ... well, Michael.
You look around a bit. You can see more, now. You're in some sort of tomb apse. You could exit--there are exits each way--but you suspect there's some horrible maze you could easily get lost in.

You take a step back from all the confident, constant chatter in the cell phones. You hear that, indeed, people are just repeating mantras, and they are not as smart as they think they are. You wonder if you should say something to the most egregious offenders ... and you eventually do! And they appear flustered. They attack you back for being too quiet. You mention that if they annoyed someone as too-quiet as you, they must have gone over the line.
Your confrontation did not go unnoticed by other cell phoners. They take the hint and moderate their voices.
However, now, a prize talk blasts through hidden loudspeakers. It exhorts you to find your dream, to find something that will help you move above and beyond everyone else. It's probably talking about money or power, but you're looking for something different.

Among all the chatter, you discover a disused booth. Someone is preaching on about environmental stuff, and it's so much less painful than cell phone chat. You worry they're just going to blab on forever, but they're so grateful you listened as long as you did. They hand you a stalk they think can grow quickly. Their own special formula. It looks weird and glittery, and if anything can reach up out of here, this can. But the question is, where can it grow to?

Ah, yes. It makes sense. You find the pole. Strangely, there's just a single switch to flip. And even more strangely, the switch you flip causes the pole to revert into the ground. Yay!
But there's more! A war pawn, like a chess piece, rolls into view. It looks pretty powerful. Maybe you see how to use it, but maybe you shouldn't use it right away.

There must be more to the short rail than you see. And you start tracing where it is, where it can be, where it should go. You find something to dig up. It's ... surprisingly malleable. You have nothing else to do, anyway. Soon it feels like pulling cable from a ground. It's tough, since you can't see around, but indeed, the short rail does lead to a shore trail that leads south.

You look into the stall and shrug your shoulders. Then the gnome (old) steps in and notes they hear something. Chittering noises! The gnome chitters back.
It takes a lot of negotiating, but you find where the mice are stuck. You and the gnome thud through and out come some mice, tall. They're tall for mice, though they really only come up above your knee.
Hmm. You have a lot of friends following you around, but you haven't talked to them much. Perhaps you could learn something from them.

The lode and the ore are tough to shift around for someone as big as yourself. But the tall mice manage to get into those small niches you can't. They locate a low door, then, point to where you can remove the ore to create a passage. You'll have to duck a bit to get in, but you can now go INSIDE. Hooray!

You freeze up, confused by all this, and the merchant takes this as a sign of arrogant disrespect. You are not the first person to reject their positivity! They run into clueless crumb-bums all day!
They storm off, presumably to find another crumb-bum to abuse for not having their brand of positivity.

They try to wheedle more money out of you, but of course, that's all you have. So you trade your final quid for the flier. The oaf liar thanks you for not totally wasting their time.

You need to prep for making things right in general. Then, once the game's over, you'll leave.

Yes. It's time to get healing. Your companions don't have as much time or energy to help as you hoped they would, but they do enough. Everyone feels better for their part in defeating the sea skull. And yet you worry it, or something like it, may be back sooner rather than later, and your companions have gone their separate ways for good. Still, you should be pleased with yourself.
!not just to make
