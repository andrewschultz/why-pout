}$REJECT1=You're stuck with what to do right now. Perhaps you can use your senses for clues, or THINK, or look inward, to give you an idea of how to get started. Not just a what, but a how or a why. You can't exactly look outward.
}$REJECT2=That thought/action/observation/request brings up nothing. Why Pout has a limited set of verbs, and the main thing is to guess a two-word phrase. To see what verbs are used, try VERBS.
