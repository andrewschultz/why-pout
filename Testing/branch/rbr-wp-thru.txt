Like most of my games, Why Pout rates merciful on the Zarfian cruelty scale. However, in this case, I want the puzzles to be more merciful in terms of general difficulty on the player's psyche than usual.
Note that an optional room will appear about midway through the game. It may contain profanity, which I hope is amusing, but I don't blame you if you wish to skip it.
blurglecruncheon@gmail.com is my email, and http://github.com/andrewschultz/why-pout is the github site, where you can report issues. I'm open to transcripts.
CREDITS lists people who helped make Why Pout a reality, or a better version than it would've been without them.  EXT shows the extensions listed, and VERSION or VERSIONS shows version info.

Yes. Now that you realize you want more than just to know your name, that you have bigger goals, you push a bit harder when you initially forget it. You remember patches of the past. You remember people harshly calling you by your last name, then your first.
Your name is Mike Orr. You even remember it's -- well, one of these two things: short for Michal, which everyone pronounced Michael until you just gave up, or ... well, Michael.
You look around a bit. You can see more, now. You're in some sort of tomb apse. You could exit--there are exits each way--but you suspect there's some horrible maze you could easily get lost in.

You look around for secrets. First, you find two pages, one a hash of horizontal lines and another that is a hash of vertical lines. You put them together ... and you see a maze. You hope you can trace a passage out.
You do! But first, you notice, under the pages, a pair of weird mechanical eyes: sly size-slice eyes! They seem quite observant, and best, they don't seem to be surveilling YOU.
You poke around a bit, hoping for even more help. But that is all. So you follow the map, hopefully to somewhere better, or not as forbidding ...

You take a step back from all the confident, constant chatter in the cell phones. You hear that, indeed, people are just repeating mantras, and they are not as smart as they think they are. You wonder if you should say something to the most egregious offenders ... and you eventually do! And they appear flustered. They attack you back for being too quiet. You mention that if they annoyed someone as too-quiet as you, they must have gone over the line.
Your confrontation did not go unnoticed by other cell phoners. They take the hint and moderate their voices.
However, now, a prize talk blasts through hidden loudspeakers. It exhorts you to find your dream, to find something that will help you move above and beyond everyone else. It's probably talking about money or power, but you're looking for something different.

Among all the chatter, you discover a disused booth. Someone is preaching on about environmental stuff, and it's so much less painful than cell phone chat. You worry they're just going to blab on forever, but they're so grateful you listened as long as you did. They hand you a stalk they think can grow quickly. Their own special formula. It looks weird and glittery, and if anything can reach up out of here, this can. But the question is, where can it grow to?

You talk with the booze troll for a bit. They seem not to know who they are, and that gives you something in common with them. They don't want to be a lousy boozer all their life. They are sick of drinking Base Ale.
You decide to trust them. They don't seem armed. You mention you've been having an adventure, and they'd sort of like one, too. They hand you a bottle of Base Ale as thanks. Not that they want you to go down their road. But it might be useful in bartering.
It looks like the new troll will be following you around. All that silence might get awkward, so you may wish to T or TALK (TO) them.

This keep has seen better days, but there seems to be a lot in its ruins. You can go back EAST. You also sense something fearsome from a passage south.
You are really impressed by how no mold grows here. Someone must be keeping it up well. Who?
A row (gold) shines in this otherwise forbidding keep.
There's a bunch of manic herb here. You don't know a lot about it, other than that some is really poisonous and some is okay. There's so much, perhaps it's hiding something.

You freeze up, confused by all this, and the merchant takes this as a sign of arrogant disrespect. You are not the first person to reject their positivity! They run into clueless crumb-bums all day!

You act distracted just right. The oaf liar tries to get your attention. Just ignoring them wouldn't work, but paying attention to a flier ... well, they take the hint that you aren't a high-rolling customer. They try to wheedle more money out of you, but of course, that's all you have. So you trade your final quid for the flier. The oaf liar thanks you for not totally wasting their time. They seem to snicker as they depart.
This transaction reduces your wealth from one quid to zero quid.

You have a clue what isle to look through. The thief isle. You get The File.
You've visited all the locations in the flier. You crumple it up as if to throw it in a trash bin. The squid makes a gesture as if it wishes to gobble the flier. You're worried it might choke on the flier, as it did for the quid, but then -- well, the water washes the paper brochure down. Odd, but hooray for clearer inventory.

INVENTORY CHANGED
There's that occasional voice ringing in your head asking "Why pout?" But besides that ...
"Good! Some goods, umm...":
!  a flier
  a plan tracker (full of ideas)
  a war pawn
You have a name, too, now, you remember: Mike Orr.

Your pep talk brings everyone together. You worry it's too simplistic, especially "titan's lairs? Titan slayers!"
But everyone seems enthused, ready for what happens next. Gathering information from everyone, you start diggint to find tunnels below. You clear out a passage below. You swear a solemn pact that everyone will defend everyone else, regardless of what happens.

The gaunt raider wasn't joking around when they said they came from some place awful! You just hope your companions can help you enough here.
A sea skull gloats evilly, with its back turned to you.

You'll probably have to alert the sea skull to your presence at some time. You try to sound authoritative when you do so. And ... well, you get its attention.
"DONE, OH?!?! DUH, NO!" it roars.
It begins pouring out rivers of blood at you and your companions. But fortunately, you have so many, that by the time it gets to you, it is not so bad. Yet it's still depressing. You think back to advice you got at the beginning ... how it seemed slightly off. What to do?

@hint

The eyes look around frantically. It feels like quite a moment, where you need a big moment or action. They show four dots, then three dots.

@all
#testcase-check-pre-wipe-out-rule-fallthrough
#testcase-run-post-wipe-out-rule-default
Easier said than done, but since you all studied the plan tracker so well, it isn't impossible!
Your makeshift weapons are just enough to distract the sea skull. It starts to focus on one party member, then the others taunt it, and it turns away. It's exhausting for you but even more exhausting for the skull, which eventually collapses and incinerates.
But after all the fireworks, there's a letdown. You feel something odd come between you and your companions now you're done. They wonder why they need to do any more. You could call the whole zeitgeist a why-division.

Well, it turns out the doom ending was for the sea skull, not for you. But you're still a bit frustrated. How do you go forward from here?
Why-division has settled in among your companions. Everyone's done what they can. Why should they do more? They've saved their skin, and a lot of others', too, and they'll be safe for a while!

Yes. It's time to get healing. Your companions don't have as much time or energy to help as you hoped they would, but they do enough. Everyone feels better for their part in defeating the sea skull. And yet you worry it, or something like it, may be back sooner rather than later, and your companions have gone their separate ways for good. Still, you should be pleased with yourself.
!not just to make
