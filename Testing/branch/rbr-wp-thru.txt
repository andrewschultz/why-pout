Yes. Now that you realize you want more than just to know your name, that you have bigger goals, you push a bit harder when you initially forget it. You remember patches of the past. You remember people harshly calling you by your last name, then your first.
Your name is Mike Orr. You even remember it's -- well, one of these two things: short for Michal, which everyone pronounced Michael until you just gave up, or ... well, Michael.
You look around a bit. You can see more, now. You're in some sort of tomb apse. You could exit--there are exits each way--but you suspect there's some horrible maze you could easily get lost in.

You take a step back from all the confident, constant chatter in the cell phones. You hear that, indeed, people are just repeating mantras, and they are not as smart as they think they are. You wonder if you should say something to the most egregious offenders ... and you eventually do! And they appear flustered. They attack you back for being too quiet. You mention that if they annoyed someone as too-quiet as you, they must have gone over the line.
Your confrontation did not go unnoticed by other cell phoners. They take the hint and moderate their voices.
However, now, a prize talk blasts through hidden loudspeakers. It exhorts you to find your dream, to find something that will help you move above and beyond everyone else. It's probably talking about money or power, but you're looking for something different.

You worry they're just going to blab on forever, but they're so grateful you listened as long as you did. They hand you a stalk they think can grow quickly. Their own special formula. It looks weird and glittery, and if anything can reach up out of here, this can. But the question is, where can it grow to?

This place seems very run-down. But it feels homey and inspires camaraderie in an odd way.
Someone comes out from the depths. They introduce themselves as the gone traitor, someone who cozied up to the bad guys and ditched their friends, then ditched the bad guys. And only recently they ran away, but how can they ask for forgiveness? Surely it just doesn't happen like this? Just one small change and you have a new identity? Rubbish!

The squid gives you and your companions a ride a few miles across the ocean. You realize you could reach the wharf isle for a war file.
When you get there, you're a bit disappointed by what you see. There's a bit too much emphasis on magic and the implements thereof, all of which are at a much too hefty price for you. So buying equipment is out.
Still, there are many ideas worth tracking. Your companions help with the process, offering ideas you're pleasantly surprised to hear.
You write the main stuff into your plan tracker, and as you do, you realize part of the plan points to having another party member not in your entourage. Well, yet. Perhaps someone else here has read the war file and maybe found less splashy ways to fight. You stay to look around...

You're not in the mood for exploring the wharf randomly. It seems like a good way to get lost. Perhaps if you focus on a specific sort of companion you need nearby, that would be better. Then you could find them and leave.

You rode the squid here, and there are all sorts of magical symbols here. It's a bit intimidating for someone like you who is clueless about magic. Maybe it's intimidating and depressing for someone else, and maybe you can more than commiserate.
You don't really trust your sense of direction here, but maybe if you knew the sort of companion you were looking for, it would help.
wait here for what to do or where to go next.

You look around and uncover a wan dwarf who wasn't good enough to be a full fighter but was rejected for magic training. You show them the plan tracker with the notes you wrote from the war file, with input from your followers.
The wan dwarf thinks for a minute, then starts filling in some blanks in your plan. Not to criticize, just ... you thought of some things they didn't, and they thought of some you didn't.
There's not much left to do here, so you ride the squid back.

# this makes sure TREE SMALL then bringing the grow vial back works okay
A tree (small) grows here, or tries to, at least. It deserves to be bigger.
But wait! You can use the grow vial! It makes the tree (small) into a tree (tall)! Then it dissolves once empty.

This is a withered, run-down former mall that had the ceiling blow off. It's walled with pictures of large, but fake, trees. You can only go back SOUTH.
A tree (tall) has grown here, thanks to you. It feels very welcoming.

Wow, man! That was some good cake! Everyone shares more of their background over this meal.
The gaunt raider, in particular, has a lot to say, of past things they did that were horrible, that they think they're sorry for, but maybe not enough.
Everyone assures the raider that they're the good guys now.
You offer the gaunt raider the knife (right) as a present. They seem scared to take it, but it doesn't burst into flames when they take it, so ... it must be right for them.

The gaunt raider raises a hand. They have an idea! The abandoned mall must have all sorts of stuff that can be fashioned into weapons. Not top-of-the-line, but enough to get by. Heartened by your recent meal, your party takes the time to find weapons. You all keep them hidden until needed.

You have a clue what isle to look through. The thief isle. You get The File.
You've visited all the locations in the flier. You crumple it up as if to throw it in a trash bin. The squid makes a gesture as if it wishes to gobble the flier. You're worried it might choke on the flier, as it did for the quid, but then -- well, the water washes the paper brochure down. Odd, but hooray for clearer inventory.

You'll probably have to alert the sea skull to your presence at some time. You try to sound authoritative when you do so. And ... well, you get its attention.
"DONE, OH?!?! DUH, NO!" it roars.
It begins pouring out rivers of blood at you and your companions. But fortunately, you have so many, that by the time it gets to you, it is not so bad. Yet it's still depressing. You think back to advice you got at the beginning ... how it seemed slightly off. What to do?

Easier said than done, but since you all studied the plan tracker so well, it isn't impossible!
Your makeshift weapons are just enough to distract the sea skull. It starts to focus on one party member, then the others taunt it, and it turns away. It's exhausting for you but even more exhausting for the skull, which eventually collapses and incinerates.
But after all the fireworks, there's a letdown. You feel something odd come between you and your companions now you're done. They wonder why they need to do any more. You could call the whole zeitgeist a why-division.

Yes. It's time to get healing. Your companions don't have as much time or energy to help as you hoped they would, but they do enough. Everyone feels better for their part in defeating the sea skull. And yet you worry it, or something like it, may be back sooner rather than later, and your companions have gone their separate ways for good. Still, you should be pleased with yourself.
