You aren't feeling too great, but you don't want or need to wipe yourself out, yet. Perhaps you can find the root of your problems and wipe it out one day, though.

Sadly, you have no friends to bring together yet! Yet.

You will want to WIPE OUT the cause of your problems once you have them in your crosshairs. That's probably not for a while, though.

>wide vision
You try to declare a wide vision, but as you do, you trip yourself up on pronunciation. Wide vision? Why division? You worry you haven't fought through enough to have a truly wide vision--sure, you solved all the puzzles you needed to, but you feel like you're missing some necessary experience and struggle you need for true, long-term leadership.
\\
>wide vision
You are unable to express your wide vision. You'll have to settle for just repairing things pretty well.
\\

Sadly, you didn't quite experience enough to spread your wide vision.
