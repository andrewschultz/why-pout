Why Pout, by Andrew Schultz

This is a walkthrough for Why Pout, my IFComp 2024 entry. While there is no precise order to do things in, you often need some companions or items to solve other puzzles.

Why Pout was meant to be smaller than my usual IFComp efforts. It has 45 puzzle points and 15 rooms in the main area.

This walkthrough attempts to get through in an optimal number of turns. However, I may have missed ways to save a move here or there. If so, it'd be neat but not critical to know.

It also parrots my test commands (w1-w13) in the file Why Pout Tests.i7x.

You can find the source at https://github.com/andrewschultz/why-pout, and any issues can be reported there.

Small obligatory warning: you may wish to try to at least get the first point before spoiling things. That's why there's a lot of introductory text here, as well as extra lines.

Also, another warning: this doesn't give the very-best ending. You can, in fact, keep the gang together after defeating the big baddie. I want to leave that as a challenge.

It also neglects the one-time cheat item that you find once you reach the main area. You should be able to figure what the command for that is, once you see it. You do not get a point for using that command.

Alternate spellings should work as well for many of the solutions. If they don't, let me know. That's easy to add. It's one of those cases where you see 90% of what you need to, but there are 30 puzzles, so something gets overlooked. And I don't mind adding relatively plausible similar words.

There's also an optional area I won't provide a walkthrough for, because it does not affect the final ending in any way besides "you missed a point or two." In fact, there is no MISSED command at the end of the game for it. There's a reason for this, and I think it's a decent one. You'll know once you manage to enter it. If you got that far, you'll understand what that area is about. If you really want to know everything, you can find the answers in the source code or test scripts.

Also, some words may require an apostrophe or hyphen, but Why Pout doesn't require them. In fact, if you try either, it notifies you they aren't necessary and it will add punctuation as needed.

=============================================

At first, there isn't much to look around at. Maybe at yourself. You can't see much else, anyway, so it's not totally self-centered to do so. You're not exactly getting a lot of help, here.

You don't have to X ME to get the first point, but X ME may provide a few hints.

There are other ways to figure that first point, too. The game should clue you to use your senses. (SEE doesn't work.) Default Inform verbs also work. If you keep hitting parser errors, a few clue phrases cycle.


































You need a name. But you just can't find one.

>an aim (1)

Now you are in a tomb apse. It looks tricky to find a way out.

>two maps (1)

Uh-oh! Hype Lane is dingy even though it promises so much.

The cell phones distract you terribly.

>self owns (1)

Oops! With those cleared, you can't help hearing prize talk.

Fortunately there are booby prizes for suckers. But they're just what you need!

>pry stalk (1)

A stalk can reach upwards...

>high plane (1)

Okay, the one-way introduction is over. Now you can explore a bit more. Or you could, if that naff haze weren't choking you everywhere. It feels eternal.

>nah phase (1)

That clears so much up! But now that you can see more, you're more visible. Passages will eventually open up in all four directions, though you need to get rid of the obstacle that makes you feel policed to move on.

And you take a small war pawn you find. You can probably guess how this helps you jump ahead of one puzzle. Note that if you are trying for the "best" ending, you can use the war pawn without fear of locking yourself out.

But first, why are you feeling policed? Where is this feeling coming from?

>pole east (1)

You don't have to go east first! However, some puzzles require us to complete previous puzzles. Going south first may be the best way to get started without too much backtracking. So let's go that way.

>shore trail (1)

>s

You have no notion of the terrain or waterways.

>known ocean (1)

A sick squid seems to be choking on something.

>six quid (1)

The money comes in handy elsewhere. You need an item to ask the squid where to go. So let's go back to the center.

>n

>grow star (1)

>n

Wolf Rock!

>wool frock (1)

Okay, now the high doubt.

>hide out (1)

>d

>boost role (1)

And another pal! The item they give you is more useful than their presence. Well, until the final fight.

>u

You've done all you can here. Well, you could deal with high doubt, but let's get through the low door first. It requires a detour.

>s

>key pillar (1)

>w

Let's get some companions!

>gnome old (1)

The wool frock fits nicely on the gnome and is removed from your inventory.

>rogue old (1)

The six quid you found come in handy to get a second companion. This costs you three. You should have three left, now.

But the next thing needs no prep.

>plan tracker (1)

Okay, now the seedy sign. (Without enough friends, it's a bit too scary.)

>see design (1)

>knife right (1)

You've done all you can here. You need another companion to deal with the manic herb.

>e

Oh my! A passage opens down! Let's get another pal for later.

>d

>gaunt raider (1)

>u

Okay, let's really explore the east.

>e

>low bend (1)

Again, the money comes in handy. And you still have some left over!

>bay sale (1)

Alternately, sail is okay because, well, you get a sale of sorts. The raft you get is indeed on sale. It costs two quid. You should have one quid left, now.

>n

Storm isle! How to get shelter?

>store mile (1)

Ditch the MEN shelf.

>mensch elf (1)

What's in MY STALL?

>mice tall (1)

You couldn't have gotten them without the gnome's wisdom. Now the mice (tall) can help you where you would've gotten stuck elsewhere.

>s

>w

>n

>low door (1)

>in

"We Loan" offers "financial services." Put the lie to that, so someone comes out to try to correct you.

>well own (1)

Some merchant.

>summer chant (1)

Now you were positive, you can go negative.

>bile oh (1)

Gloat about your solitude!

>whee lone (1)

Oops, no more solitude, but the oaf-liar has something. You can misspell it with a y, if you'd like.

>oh flier (1)

Finally, the last of your money!

(By the way, if you try to get the flier earlier, you don't pay right away. The oaf-liar gets greedy and wants more than just one quid. So you have to come back when you're almost broke. Just to check, you should have given the rogue and the bay sale three and two quid each.)

>out

>s

We can complete the keep now.

>w

The manic herb is tricky.

>manna curb (1)

>e

>s

The flier tells you where to look or go.

>grow vial (1)

This (grove isle) was always available, but the below (wharf isle) requires an instrument of battle.

>war file (1)

This kicks you to the Wand Wharf, where you can find an outcast...

>wan dwarf (1)

Now you're back to the Known Ocean.

>n
>e
>n
>n

>tree small (1)

Oh look! The grow vial helped the tree grow!

A perfect place to get to know your friends! Well, this could've been done at any time. The game should have nagged you several times. But if this walkthrough was just too gloriously readable to pull your eyes away, well, I'm flattered. (I've been there with other walkthroughs!)

>t dwarf

>t elf

>t mice

>t gnome

>t rogue

>t troll

>t raider

(Sorry, no points for all this. Also, the order doesn't matter.)

Oh no! A talk-ache! But it gives you an idea.

The knife and manna can make ...

>tall cake (1)

You can't eat it by yourself!

>treat all (1)

My, such lively discussion. We're ready for the big picture. One more isle on the flier to visit!

>s

>s

>w

>s

>the file (1)

Now the endgame.

>n

>d

Since everyone's here, ...

>were meetin (1)

Pep talk time!

>my corps (1)

>d

The sea skull needs to be told what's what.

>cease cull (1)

Finally. You've been waiting all game for this! Or maybe you haven't.

>wipe out (1)

You'll notice that there is why-division, now. There is an alternate ending where you can change it into something better, but you're locked out of it at this moment. (As the author, I'm being evasive about this. The code is available on GitHub, if you really want to find it. Also, there is a bonus point for disposing of the War Pawn the right way. Again, go see GitHub.)

Now, to end things. Not with a Doom End but ...

>do mending (1)

"Due mend/mending" or "do mend" also works. Trivia: the room was originally called Doom End, but Ending seemed to give a clearer puzzle answer.

I hope you enjoyed this!
