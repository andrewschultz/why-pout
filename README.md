# Why Pout?

A wordplay game with a mechanic that has not been tried yet.

Release 1 submitted on 8/28/2024 to IFComp
(Note: several fixes during IFComp. They are listed in fixes.txt.)
Release 2 re-submitted to ifarchive and itch.io on 10/18/2024
Release 3 is possible, with a bonus point and more granular responses to THINK. These may be split up into separate releases, too.

Post-comp release is slated for late October.

A word on the bonus point at the end: there are ways to search the source code to find it. I won't spoil them here, but there are a few intuitive ways you could find them easily.

Post-comp I will add a file with test commands that explains the logic, but for now, I'm keeping it hidden.
