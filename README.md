# Why Pout?

A wordplay game with a mechanic that has not been tried yet.

Release 1 submitted on 8/28/2024 to IFComp
(Note: several fixes during IFComp. They are listed in fixes.txt.)
Release 2 re-submitted to ifarchive and itch.io on 10/18/2024
Release 3 has two bonus points and will be submitted to ifarchive and itch.io with a quick turnaround.
Release 4 is very likely. It will contain dialogue based on the game mechanic, between friends, as you find them
Release 5 is possible. It will provide more granular responses to THINK.

A word on the bonus point at the end: there are ways to search the source code to find it. I won't spoil them here, but there are a few intuitive ways you could find them easily. Let's just say I wouldn't release something untested.
