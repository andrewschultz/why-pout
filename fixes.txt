List of in-comp updates

9/3/2024 updates (1.04)

9/2/2024 updates (1.03)
--fixed case where homonym rule was in the wrong main table row (the right rule was absent, so I wrote it in, too)
--renamed wbase.txt to walkthrough.txt, since wbase.txt was originally meant to fork to walkthrough.txt and walkthrough-full.txt, and I've opted not to give a full walkthrough
--better cluing of approximately how close you are to the tricky point at/near the end on reject
--war pawn's description tuned up

--fixed bug for missing THINK text in room below hub

9/1/2024(a) bug fixes (1.01)

Cheat item improvements:
--cheat item no longer used up if its suggested available solution is something you guessed before but weren't ready to execute yet
--cheat item now rattles (not just stays silent) if you are in a room with something to do, but you can't do it yet
--switched a few rows in table of puzzle solutions, so trickier puzzle comes first, to maximize the cheat item's value

Game text improvements:
--removed debug text that sometimes appeared in jump-ahead cheat
--some conjugation cases with multiple companions "a and b follows you north" fixed
--maximum possible remaining score, not tracked at all in the initial submission, is now tracked properly
--Haze/main hub room rearranged print order of exits, with current companions pushed to the bottom for continuity/readability
--scenery item removed in Haze/main hub room after solving first puzzle makes it superfluous
--to jibe with the narrative, an item briefly appears in inventory before climbing to the Haze/main hub room

Miscellaneous improvements:
--walkthrough tweaks
