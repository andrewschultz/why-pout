Why Pout, by Andrew Schultz

A walkthrough.

So there isn't much to look around at. Maybe at yourself. It feels a bit self-centered.

You need a name. But you just can't find one.

>an aim (1)

Now you are in a tomb apse. It looks tricky to find a way out.

>two maps (1)

Uh-oh! Hype Lane is dingy even though it promises so much.

The prize talk, in particular, is annoying. But there are some booby prizes for suckers.

>pry stalk (1)

>high plane (1)

Okay, the one-way introduction is over. Now you can explore a bit more. Or you could, if that naff haze weren't choking you everywhere. It feels eternal.

>nah phase (1)

That clears so much up! But now that you can see more, you're more visible. Why are you feeling policed? Where is this feeling coming from?

>pole east (1)

But we don't have to go east first! Let's clear things to the north. The gross tar can go.

>grow star (1)

>n

High doubt.

>hide out (1)

>d

Okay, a booze troll here needs some self-esteem.

>boost role (1)

The lobe end appears to be the end, except it isn't.

>low bend (1)

The storm isle is isolated! There's no way back!

>store mile (1)

What to do with My Stall?

>mice tall (1)

What about that short rail, now you're back?

>shore trail (1)

A sick squid seems to be choking on something.

>six quid (1)

Now from the flyer, you have three possible places to go. The third isn't available, because it's too vague, and you don't want to make the squid work any harder than it has to.

But you can visit the wharf isle!

>war file (1)

You can also visit the grove isle!

>grow vial (1)

Note you can't tackle Thief Isle yet.

=============================================================================

So, in Worm-Eaten, you can finally do what you want.

>were meetin (1)

But how do you show leadership? It's inside you. More precisely, it's in your name.

>my corps (1)

Oh no! The doom end! Or so it seems. The most obvious choice doesn't work with the sea skull still there.

>cease cull (1)

The blood gets over a lot of people, but it's spread out, so nobody's killed.

>wipe out (1)

Now you have won, but where is the healing process?

>do mend (1)
